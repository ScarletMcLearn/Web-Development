In fact, research shows that reunion can cause more stress in people\u2019s lives than deployment. That\u2019s not to say that returning service members and their family and friends aren\u2019t happy about the homecoming. They\u2019re usually ecstatic. The stress comes from the changes that have taken place and concern for what life will now be like.\nSpend time with family and friends.\u00a0For months, the people who are closest to you have been living with the fear of something happening to you. Make a special effort to spend time with them or, if they are far away, call often to support and reassure them.\nView stress as normal.\u00a0Returning to your everyday life is a major change, and change always creates stress. If accepted and handled constructively, stress can be turned into a source of excitement and enthusiasm about new beginnings with family and friends.\nGo slowly.\u00a0Take time to ease back into your routine. Make a list of those things that must be done -- such as banking, making living arrangements, contacting friends and relatives -- and take them one by one. Trying to do too much too soon will only add to your stress level. Consider putting off major decisions until you\u2019ve had plenty of time to readjust.\nCommunicate with others.\u00a0Talking with others about your experiences and what you\u2019re feeling can help relieve stress. It\u2019s not a sign of weakness. Talk with a trusted relative, friend, faith leader or family services staffer. Military chaplains can be helpful, as most receive training in pastoral counseling and crisis.\nTake care of your physical health.\u00a0Get plenty of rest and exercise, eat properly, and avoid drugs and excessive drinking.\nDo things you find relaxing.\u00a0Go fishing, attend a concert, or take a long soak in the tub. Be kind to yourself.\nWatch what you spend.\u00a0Now that you\u2019re back, the urge to spend will be strong. Don\u2019t spend more than you can afford.\nStart the rebuilding process together.\u00a0Do it as a family. Make the decision that this time will serve to make you and your family even stronger. Get involved in positive activities that encourage togetherness and reassurance.\nExpect something of a letdown.\u00a0Most, if not all, service members experience it. It simply means that you\u2019re no longer running on pure adrenalin and that things are beginning to settle down. Or, it may mean that the homecoming hasn\u2019t solved all the problems that existed before the mobilization. Possibly, your reunion didn\u2019t go the way you thought it would. Whatever the reason, it\u2019s perfectly normal to feel this way. However, if this feeling doesn\u2019t go away, it could be a sign of something more serious. Read about this in the Mental Health America Fact Sheet, \u201cWhen the Letdown Doesn\u2019t Let Up.\u201d\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "If you feel overwhelmed by your homecoming, seek help. It's not a sign of weakness. Nearly every military installation has a family service center, family support center or Army community service center where you can access information, referral, counseling, and crisis intervention services. In addition, all military families, including National Guard members and Reservists who are activated for more than 30 days, are eligible for medical and mental health care either at a military medical treatment facility or at a civilian facility through TRICARE, the administrator of health services for the armed services.
