For example, they may fear they will be punished for six months\u2019 of bad behavior. They may also fear you\u2019ll \u201cabandon\u201d them again. Put their minds at rest.\nRemember that change is just as stressful for children as it is for adults\u00a0\u2013 probably more so because they have so little experience coping with it. Sometimes they act out. Remember this before you punish your child.\nDon\u2019t expect the same behavior.\u00a0He or she has grown physically, emotionally and socially. This is not the same child as when you left.\nTry to avoid power struggles with both your spouse and your children.\u00a0Take it slowly as you, and they, readjust to your presence.\nBe patient.\u00a0This period of transition will last several weeks \u2013 and it can be awkward. You can ease this by reviewing schoolwork, looking at family photos or asking your children about their activities.\nAllow them to express their feelings. Don\u2019t try to force positive responses. Preschoolers may act coolly toward you. Acting aggressively or disinterested is their way of showing their hurt and anger at you for leaving. This behavior, though unsettling, usually doesn\u2019t last long. Just tell them how much you missed them, and how you\u2019re looking forward to hearing about the things they did while you were away.\nYou can use the same strategies with older children.\u00a0Express interest in their schoolwork and social activities, and make them feel a part of your life by telling them about your own experiences. Older children usually understand war and deployment a little better than younger ones, but this doesn\u2019t mean they didn\u2019t miss you. Tell them how much you missed them.\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Of Special Importance to New Fathers\n\tIf you were away for the birth or the first year of your baby\u2019s life, you\u2019ll be coming home to a whole new family.

Here are some tips:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nCommunicate openly and frequently with both the caregiver and the child.\nInvolve the caregiver in the transition.\u00a0Forcing the child to suddenly separate can be just as traumatic as when you left.\nAsk how things were done while you were gone.
