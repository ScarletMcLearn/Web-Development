A person with bipolar disorder can go from feeling very, very high (called mania) to feeling very, very low (depression). With proper treatment, people can control these mood swings and lead fulfilling lives. While the rate of bipolar disorder is the same among African Americans as it is among other Americans, African Americans are less likely to receive a diagnosis and, therefore, treatment for this illness.\nMost African Americans with bipolar disorder are going undiagnosed and untreated.\nSeveral factors have contributed to African Americans not receiving help for bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses. Some of the reasons are:\n\nA mistrust of health professionals, based in part on historically higher-than-average institutionalization of African Americans with mental illness; and on previous mistreatments, like such tragic events as the Tuskegee syphilis study.\nCultural barriers between many doctors and their patients.\nReliance on family and religious community, rather than mental health professionals, during times of emotional distress.\nA tendency to talk about physical problems, rather than discuss mental symptoms, or to mask symptoms with substance abuse or other medical conditions.\nSocioeconomic factors which can limit access to medical and mental health care. About 25 percent of African Americans do not have health insurance.\nContinued misunderstanding and stigma about mental illness.\n\nSigns of\u00a0bipolar disorder\nBipolar disorder often starts in the teen years, but can emerge in later life. It is a potentially life-threatening illness that a person cannot handle alone. Tragically, one of five people with bipolar disorder commits suicide. The signs of bipolar disorder include:\nMANIA\n\nExcessive energy, restlessness, racing thoughts and rapid talking\nDenial that anything is wrong\nExtremely happy feelings\nEasily irritated\nNeeding little sleep\nUnrealistic belief in one\u2019s ability\nPoor judgment\nSustained, unusual behavior\nIncreased sex drive\nSubstance abuse\nAggressive behavior\nParanoia\n\nDEPRESSION\n\nPoor appetite or eating too much\nTrouble sleeping or sleeping too much\nNervousness and worry\nLoss of interest in and withdrawal from usual activities\nFeelings of sadness that don\u2019t go away\nIrritability or restlessness\nLack of energy\nFeelings of sadness, worthlessness or guilt\nInability to think or concentrate\nRepeated thoughts of death or suicide\nChronic pain or other physical problems that don\u2019t respond to treatment\nIncreased risk-taking behavior, including reckless driving or substance abuse\n\nNo one knows for certain what causes bipolar disorder. But its causes may include:\n\n\nBrain chemistry\u00a0\u2013 There are chemical changes or imbalances in the brain during both extremes of behavior (mania and depression).\n\n\nGenetics\u00a0\u2013 Close relatives of people with bipolar disorder are 10 to 20 times more likely to get depression or bipolar disorder than other people.\n\n\nDrug and alcohol abuse\u00a0\u2013 More than half of the people diagnosed with bipolar disorder have histories of substance abuse. In some cases, substance abuse precedes the development of the problem; in others, alcohol or other drugs may be used as a form of self-medication.\n\n\nStressful or disturbing events\u00a0\u2013 Both can cause mood swings\n\n\nBipolar disorder can be treated.\nThere is hope. People with bipolar disorder can be helped by treatment. Treatment can include:\n\nMedication\u00a0\u2013 The doctor may recommend one or more medicines to find what works best.\nCounseling\u00a0\u2013 Often, psychotherapy or other forms of counseling are used in combination with medication.\nPeer Support\u00a0\u2013 The advice and support of others who have bipolar disorder can aid recovery.\nComplementary Care\u00a0\u2013 Some people benefit from exercise, stress reduction classes and other activities to complement their treatment and help them manage their illness.\nECT, or electroconvulsive therapy \u2013 This is used as a last resort to treat severe bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts. It\u2019s only considered when medication and therapy haven\u2019t worked.\n\nIf you think that you or someone you know has bipolar disorder, talk with your primary care physician or faith leader. However, only a mental health professional can tell if a person has bipolar disorder and properly treat it. Once in treatment, it is important that the person receive the support and understanding of friends and family. Many people also find strength and support through their religious and spiritual affiliations.\nOther Resources\nNational Medical Association\n\t\t\t(for a list of African American doctors)\n\t\t\t(888) 662-7497\nwww.nmanet.org\nBlack Psychiatrists of America\n\t\t\t(510) 834-7103\nAmerican Association of Pastoral Counselors\n\t\t\t(703) 385-6967\nwww.aapc.org\nDepression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA)\n\t\t\t730 N.
