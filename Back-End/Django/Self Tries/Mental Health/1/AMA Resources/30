Many adolescents will turn to social media sites, such as Instagram and Twitter, to find a source of support and to connect with others that are experiencing the same things that they are. However, posts on social media can also encourage self-destructive behavior. Research has shown that viewing content about self-harm, especially on social media, can be a trigger for behavior. [3]"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "While websites that specifically encourage self-harm or suicide are few in number, and certain social media apps have banned self-injury related content, online communities related to self-harm are still common. Furthermore, research has shown that youth that visit self-harm/suicide websites are 11 times more likely to have thoughts about hurting themselves.

Feelings of shame can cause teenagers to feel heightened levels of distress and anxiety, and teens may resort to cutting and other forms of self-injury in order to relieve these negative feelings.

Because self-injury is relatively common, it\u2019s likely that there are people around who understand and can help. Try talking to a professional person around you, someone like your\u00a0school psychiatrist, school nurse, or guidance counselor.\u00a0If you\u2019re not comfortable with that, think about contacting your local MHA Affiliate\u00a0or checking out the S.A.F.E Alternatives website.\n\n\nKnow you can get better.\u00a0This is a difficult time in your life.\u00a0However, with help, you can get to the point where you don\u2019t hurt yourself anymore.\n\n\nIf cutting or self-injuring is an activity that your friends do, or if you find yourself comparing self-harm behaviors, consider widening your social circle and hanging out with other people. This doesn't mean you have to abandon your current friends; it\u00a0just means making\u00a0new ones who don't remind you of self-injuring.\n\n\nFigure out what stresses you out and drives you to self-injure. Avoid stressors\u00a0if they are going to make you cut. Think about other things you could do to manage stress without turning to self-injury. Check out this list of distractions and alternatives.\n\n\nSeek professional help - effective treatment is available for people who injure themselves. You'll have to talk to your parents to get started. \u00a0For tips on having a conversation, check out, Time to Talk: Tips for Talking About Your Mental Health and Time to Talk: Talking to Your Parents.\n\n\nIt could take some time to see a doctor or other treatment\u00a0provider. In the meantime, take steps to reduce the harm you are doing to yourself. This could mean hurting yourself fewer times than you normally would, making sure you don't get infections, or finding alternatives\u00a0that are less harmful (like holding an ice cube, or snapping yourself with a rubber band).\n\n"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "How Can I Help a Friend who Self-Injures?"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\n\nAsk about it. If your friend is hurting him/herself, they may be glad to have you bring it up so they can talk about it.\u00a0If someone is not injuring themself, they are not going to\u00a0start just because you said something about it.\n\n\nOffer options, but don\u2019t tell\u00a0anyone what they\u00a0should\u00a0do, or\u00a0have to\u00a0do.\u00a0If a person is using self-injury as a way to have some control, it won\u2019t help if you try to take control of the situation.\u00a0Helping your friend see ways to get help \u2013 like talking to a mental health professional,\u00a0parent, teacher, or school counselor\u00a0- may be the best thing you can do for them.\n\n\nSeek support.\u00a0Knowing a friend is hurting themself can be frightening and stressful. Consider telling a teacher or other trusted adult. This person could help your friend get the help he or she needs. You may feel that you don\u2019t have the right to tell anyone else, but remember;\u00a0you can still talk to a mental health professional about how the situation is affecting you, or you can get more information and advice from any number of organizations.\n\n\nRemember you\u2019re not responsible for ending the self-abuse.\u00a0You can\u2019t make your friend stop hurting themself or get help from a professional. The only sure thing you can do is keep being a good friend.\n\n"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Tips for Parents\u00a0[7][8]"}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "Do:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nBe patient.\nLearn about self-injury.\nAddress the issue as soon as possible\u2014before stage 4.\nValidate your child\u2019s feelings. Remember that this is different from validating the behavior.\nSpeak to your child in calm tones, offer reassurance, and be a respectful listener.\nCheck in on how your child is doing regularly. Ask open ended questions to build healthy communication habits.\nAsk them what they need for support in order to stop their self-injury.\nTake your child seriously. It is likely that your child is cutting in order to relieve feelings of stress, and not because they are seeking attention.\nGive praise for positive change as you see it. When looking for improvement, look back over six-month period rather than focusing on short periods of time.\nFocus on your child. It isn\u2019t uncommon for parents to feel overwhelmed or wonder what they did wrong. Find supports to help you work through your own feelings and needs so that you can focus on supporting your child.\nTake care of yourself. Model what good self-care looks like.\nMaintain hope. Recovery takes time and feels difficult, but don\u2019t give up.\n"}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "Do Not"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nThink of ongoing self-injury as failures. Getting better is a process and \u201crelapsing\u201d in self-injury happens. When it does, identify what can change to improve chances for the future.\nResponding in hurtful ways (yelling, giving harsh and lengthy punishments, threats, insults, etc.) increases stress for everyone and creates barriers to getting better.\nFight for power or control. You cannot control another person\u2019s behavior and demanding that your child stop the behavior is generally unproductive.\nRationalize the behavior by thinking that your teen is just going through a phase that will be outgrown. The majority of adults who self-injure started their self-injury during adolescence.\nMinimize the seriousness of this behavior. Cutting is often used to relieve feelings of stress, and reduce negative emotions\nIsolate your child. Your child needs ongoing support for recovery and this includes staying connected with friends. Find a way to talk about this issue if there are disagreements to find a compromise that doesn\u2019t require isolation.\nFocus on the self-injury. Concentrate on what is driving the behavior, not the behavior itself.\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "\u00a0"}, {"tag": "hr", "content": ""}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "Sources"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "[1] Kerr, P.
