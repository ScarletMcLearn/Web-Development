Dissociation seems to fall on a continuum of severity. Mild dissociation would be like daydreaming, getting \u201clost\u201d in a book, or when you are driving down a familiar stretch of road and realize that you do not remember the last several miles. A severe and more chronic form of dissociation is seen in the disorder Dissociative Identity Disorder, once called Multiple Personality Disorder, and other Dissociative Disorders.\nHow Common is Dissociation?\nTransient and mild dissociative experiences are common. Almost 1/3rd of people say they occasionally feel as though they are watching themselves in a movie, and 4% say they feel that way as much as 1/3rd of the time. The incidence of these experiences is highest in youth and steadily declines after the age of 20.\n7% of the population may have suffered from a dissociative disorder at some time. But these disorders are difficult to identify and may go undiagnosed for many years.\nOther Forms of Dissociation\nOther dissociative disorders include \u201cpsychogenic amnesia\u201d (the inability to recall personally significant memories), \u201cpsychogenic fugue\u201d (memory loss characteristic of amnesia, loss of one\u2019s identity, and fleeing from one\u2019s home environment), and \u201cmultiple personality\u201d (the person has two or more distinct personalities that alternate with one another. This is also known as \u201cDissociative Identity Disorder\u201d or \u201cMultiple Personality Disorder\u201d).\nTreatment\nWhen dissociative experiences are the central, chronic, and overwhelming problem, treatment usually demands long-term individual psychotherapy. People with these disorders often have good reasons to mistrust authority as well as a lifelong habit of keeping secrets from themselves and others. A working alliance must be established with an often demoralized and suspicious person who believes the world is unjust or that he/she is an evil person.\nOther Resources\nThe International Society for the Study of Dissociation\n\t\t8201 Greensboro Drive, Suite 300\n\t\tMcLean, VA\u00a0 22102\n\t\tPhone Number: (703) 610-9037\n\t\tFax Number: (703) 610-9005\n\t\tWebsite URL:\u00a0www.issd.org\n\nSidran Institute\n\t\t200 E.
