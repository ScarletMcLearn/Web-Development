Additionally, sleep helps restore your body\u2019s energy, repair muscle tissue and triggers the release of hormones that effect growth and appetite.1"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Just like exercise, the amount of sleep you need depends on your age. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute recommends at least 11-12 hours for preschool-aged children, 10 hours for school-aged children, 9-10 hours for teens and 7-8 hours for adults.2"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Quality of sleep matters too. Quality of sleep refers to how much time you spend in REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. REM is the most restorative of the 5 cycles of sleep and should account for one-fourth of the time you spend sleeping. For example, an adult who sleeps 8 hours in a night should spend a total of 2 hours in REM sleep."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "If you don\u2019t get enough sleep, or good quality sleep every once in a while, you may notice that you wake up feeling groggy, not well rested, and experience difficulty concentrating. If you consistently do not get enough quality sleep, you are at higher risk for conditions like heart disease, diabetes, obesity, headaches and depression. Try to stay in the suggested guidelines for amount of sleep - getting too much sleep on a regular basis can be problematic for health as well.3"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "If you feel as though you are not getting enough sleep on a regular basis and it is affecting your work or personal life, talk to your primary care doctor to discuss whether you may have an underlying sleep disorder, like insomnia or sleep apnea."}, {"tag": "table", "content": "\n\n\n\nTips for Getting a Good Night's Sleep\n\n\n\n\n\nAvoid stimulants like caffeine and nicotine in the evening.\nSet a wake and sleep schedule to go by every day of the week, including weekends.Your body temperature drops during sleep--keep your thermostat at a cool, but comfortable, temperature between 60-70 degrees.\nAvoid afternoon naps.\nTry not to watch TV or do work in bed; if you do, stop an hour before you would like to be asleep so your brain has time to unwind.\nIf you typically exercise in the afternoon or evening, try to fit your workout in earlier in the day.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"tag": "div", "content": "\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nDid You Know?\n\n\n\n\nInsomnia in the US workforce costs businesses over $63 billion in lost productivity over the course of a year.4\n50% of American adults do not get the recommended amounts of aerobic and muscle-strengthening exercise.5\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nRelaxation\nWhile there are no specific guidelines for how much relaxation a person should incorporate into their lifestyle, making time to unwind and enjoy life is an important part of maintaining good health. Deep relaxation, like meditation, when practiced regularly not only relieves stress and anxiety, but also is shown to improve mood. Deep relaxation has many other potential benefits as well\u2014it can decrease blood pressure, relieve pain, and improve your immune and cardiovascular systems.6\nMaking time to find enjoyment is also an important element of relaxation. Laughing decreases pain, may help your heart and lungs, promotes muscle relaxation and can reduce anxiety.\nIf you aren\u2019t getting enough time to relax, you may find yourself feeling tense and stressed out. Long-term stress, if not addressed, can cause a host of health issues, including chest pain, headaches, digestive issues, anxiety, depression changes in sexual desire and the ability to focus.7\n\n\n\n\nQuick Ways to Relax\n\n\n\n\n\nRelease the body\u2019s feel-good hormones\u2014serotonin, prolactin, and oxytocin\u2014and lower the stress hormone, cortisol, by petting a dog for 15 minutes.9\nHuman touch releases serotonin, and reduces blood pressure and heart rate, making you more relaxed.10 A nice massage, or a simple hug may help put you at ease.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nExercise\nGetting the appropriate amount of exercise benefits nearly all aspects of a person\u2019s health. Not only does exercise help control weight, it also improves mental health, mood, chances of living longer, and the strength of your bones and muscles.8\nAdults ages 18 and over (including older adults) need at least 2\u00bd hours of moderate aerobic activity each week and muscle strengthening exercises twice a week. Children and adolescents need an hour of physical activity every day, with vigorous activity at least 3 days each week. They also need muscle and bone strengthening exercises at least 3 days of the week.8\nModerate intensive activities include briskly walking, gardening, playing doubles tennis or a leisurely bike ride. Vigorous intensive activities include jogging, running, swimming laps, jumping rope, hiking or group activities like Zumba or step aerobics. Muscle-strengthening activities to include in your routine twice a week include yoga, lifting weights, resistance band exercises and body-weight resistance activities like push ups and sit ups. You don\u2019t have to spend hours on a treadmill each day to meet the recommended amounts of physical activity. Ten minutes of moderate or vigorous activity at a time 15 times a week (roughly twice a day) will take care of it.\nNot getting enough exercise puts you at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure and some cancers. Additionally, if you sit or stand for too long, you are more likely to have back pain, so it is important to alternate standing and sitting throughout the day and make sure to move around periodically.8\n"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Sources"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "1http://sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/what-happens-when-you-sleep"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "2 https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sdd/howmuch.html"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "3http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/features/not-enough-sleep-7-serious-health-risks"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "4Kessler RC; Berglund PA; Coulouvrat C; Hajak G; Roth T; Shahly V; Shillington AC; Stephenson JJ; Walsh JK.
