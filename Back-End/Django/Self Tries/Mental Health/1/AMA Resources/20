It is the second leading cause of death among people ages 15-24. [4]\nMore years of life are lost to suicide than to any other single cause except heart disease and cancer [5]\n44,000 Americans die by suicide each year. There are 13.8 deaths by suicide per 100,000 persons each year. [6]\nThere is one death by suicide for every 25 attempts [7]\n40% of persons who\u00a0complete suicide\u00a0have made a previous attempt. [8] Nine of out ten people who attempt suicide and survive, do not go on to complete suicide at a later date. \u00a0[9]\nPrevious suicide attempts serve as a risk factor for completed suicide. Suicide risk is 37% higher in the first year after deliberate self-harm than in the general population. Older white adults have triple the suicide risk than younger, non-white adults. [10]\u00a0\nSuicide rates are highest among adults between 45 and 64 at 19.6 per 100,000. The second highest rate is 19.4 per 100,000 among those 85 years or older. Compared with middle-aged older adults, younger populations have consistently lower suicide rates. While males are four times more likely to do die by suicide, females are three times more likely to attempt suicide. \u00a0[11]\nThose with substance abuse disorders are six times more likely to complete suicide than those without. The rate of completed suicide among men with alcohol/drug abuse problems is 2-3 times higher than among those without a problem. Women who abuse substances are at 6-9 times higher risk of suicide compared to women who do not have a problem.

The most common ways to treat underlying illnesses associated with suicide are with medication, talk therapy or a combination of the two.\nCognitive (talk therapy) and behavioral (changing behavior) therapies\u00a0aim at relieving the despair of suicidal patients by showing them other solutions to their problems and new ways to think about themselves and their world. Behavioral methods, such as training in assertiveness, problem-solving, social skills, and muscle relaxation, may reduce depression, anxiety, and social ineptitude.\nCognitive and behavioral homework assignments are planned\u00a0in collaboration with the patient and explained as experiments that will be educational even if they fail. The therapist emphasizes that the patient is doing most of the work, because it is especially important for a person thinking about suicide\u00a0not to see the therapist as necessary for their survival.\nRecent research strongly supports the use of medication\u00a0to treat the underlying depression associated with suicide. Antidepressant medication acts on chemical pathways of the brain related to mood. There are many very effective antidepressants. The two most common types are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs). Other new types of antidepressants (e.g. alpha-2 antagonist, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and aminoketones), and an older class, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), are also prescribed by some doctors.\nAntidepressant medications are not habit-forming.\u00a0Although some symptoms such as insomnia, often improve within a week or two, it may take three or four weeks before you feel better; the full benefit of medication may require six to eight weeks of treatment. Sometimes changes need to be made in dosage or medication type before improvements are noticed. It is usually recommended that medications be taken for at least four to nine months after the depressive symptoms have improved. People with chronic depression may need to stay on medication to prevent or lessen further episodes.\nPeople taking antidepressants should be monitored by a doctor\u00a0who knows about treating clinical depression to ensure the best treatment with the fewest side effects. It is also very important that your doctor be informed about all other medicines that are taken, including vitamins and herbal supplements, in order to help avoid dangerous interactions. Alcohol or other drugs can interact negatively with antidepressant medication.\nDo not discontinue medication without discussing the decision with your doctor.\n"}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "Resources in Your Community"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nTelephone hotlines (Can be obtained from the telephone book, local Mental Health Associations, community centers, or United Way chapters)\nClergy\nMedical professionals\nLaw-enforcement agencies\n"}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "More Information"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, call\u00a01-800-SUICIDE\u00a0(1-800-784-2433) or\u00a01-800-273-TALK\u00a0(1-800-273-8255)."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "1-800-784-2433\nwww.hopeline.com\n\tThis will connect you with a crisis center in your area."}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "From our Partners:"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Read stories from people who have dealt with suicide or suicidal ideation at The Mighty."}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "Other Resources"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry\n\t3615 Wisconsin Ave., N.W.\n\tWashington, D.C.\u00a0 20016-3007\n\tPhone Number: (202) 966-7300\n\tFax: (202) 966-2891\n\tEmail Address:\u00a0clinical@aacap.org\n\tWebsite URL:\u00a0www.aacap.org"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "American Association of Suicidology\n\tPhone Number: (202) 237-2280\n\tWebsite URL:\u00a0www.suicidology.org"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "American Foundation for Suicide Prevention\n\tPhone Number: 888-333-AFSP (2377)\n\tWebsite URL:\u00a0www.afsp.org"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Sources"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "[1]\u00a0Strom, P., & Strom, R.
