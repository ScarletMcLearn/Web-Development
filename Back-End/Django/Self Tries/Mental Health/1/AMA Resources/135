Time consuming thoughts about appearance make it difficult to focus on schoolwork, and it can lead to students failing tests and having trouble concentrating in class."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Furthermore, BDD can interfere with an individual\u2019s ability to interact with classmates and teachers, and may even prevent students from attending school at all \u2013 some teens have reported missing an entire year of school because of BDD. One study found that 18 percent of students with BDD dropped out of school entirely because their symptoms were so severe. [2]"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Additionally, transitions, like those from middle school to high school, can be particularly nerve-wracking for those with BDD. While adjusting to a new school environment, individuals with BDD may experience an increase in their appearance-related thoughts and urges to ritualize. New classrooms, locker rooms, cafeterias, and bathrooms may cause added anxiety because they may trigger concerns about lighting or mirrors.

Body shame appears to drive social isolation. In one study, 94 percent of youth with BDD described experiencing social difficulties resulting from embarrassment and shame related to their appearance. [4]"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "While social media may not cause body dysmorphic disorder, it may act as a trigger in those already genetically predisposed to the disorder, or it could worsen existing symptoms. For example, teenagers are particularly prone to developing BDD, and if \u201cideals\u201d of appearance are presented to them through social media, this can trigger their development of the illness.

The way you view and speak about your own appearance creates a powerful example \u2013 by accepting your appearance, weight, and any perceived flaws, you set a positive example.\nBe a good listener.\nCreate a positive and supportive environment in your household.\nExpressing your own concern for your loved one can be a motivation to seek help, but can also increase guilt. Keep the focus on how your loved one would benefit from the support of a professional who truly understands the condition, rather than expressing how their illness negatively affects you.\u00a0Need some tips on how to talk to your child or teen about their mental health?
