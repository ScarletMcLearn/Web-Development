Where you live can be a significant indicator of how well\u00a0you live as well as how long you live. Such non-medical factors influence health and wellbeing,\u00a0including health-related knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors.(2) Socioeconomic\u00a0inequalities in health have been widening for decades. In the United States the data consistently\u00a0show that people living in poverty, and particularly those who are minorities, bear a\u00a0disproportionate burden of exposure to unhealthy environments and are at greater risk for mental and behavioral health-related\u00a0conditions.3 In addition to health literacy, gender, education, sexual orientation and geography; culture, acculturation, language, race,\u00a0ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and social exclusion significantly influence overall health status as well.4 These factors tend to be\u00a0interrelated and contribute to disparities among, as well as within, groups."}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Why address the social determinants of health?"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Creating a framework that incorporates the social determinants of health can provide a more complete picture of why people become\u00a0ill initially, and, moreover, what it will take to restore their health.

Policy changes to alleviate the social determinants of health, such as poverty,\u00a0racism, violence and access to resources, can have a far reaching impact on improving the health of a community, state or county.\u00a0Addressing only the symptoms of illness and ignoring its root cause will not improve population health."}, {"tag": "table", "content": "\n\n\n\nLanguage of Social Determinants\n\n\n\nHealth\na state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not just the absence of illness\n\n\nSocial Exclusion\na multidimensional process of progressive social rupture, detaching groups and individuals from social relations and institutions and preventing them from full participation in the normal, normatively prescribed activities of the society in which they live\n\n\nOppression\nthe exercise of authority or power in a burdensome, cruel, or unjust manner\n\n\nAcculturation\ncultural modification by an individual, group or community by adapting to or borrowing traits from another culture\n\n\nSocial Gradient\nthe extent of the difference in wealth and opportunity between those with the most and those with the least\n\n\nStructural Racism\nthe differential access to the goods, services, and opportunities of society.
