Individuals with BPD traits develop maladaptive behaviors that can be difficult for friends and families to understand, often resulting in chaotic relationships. People with personality disorders often use \u201cdefense mechanisms\u201d, or coping strategies, that allow them to deny responsibility for their feelings and actions. One defense is called \u201csplitting\u201d \u2013 putting some people on a pedestal while devaluing others. Another defense is called \u201cprojective identification\u201d - which involves denying one\u2019s feelings, attributing them to someone else, and then behaving in a way that causes the other person to respond in kind. For example, when the borderline person\u2019s hostility is reciprocated, they can think and/or act as though it were not their own."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Families of people who suffer from the disorder are often at a loss in knowing what to do and where to turn.\u00a0 Patients who stay healthily emotionally involved with their family members are more likely to have a better outcome.

Medication, though, is rarely effective without individual therapy and group or family therapy as the cornerstone. Psychotherapy in the form of Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is considered a gold standard and is nearly always chosen for treatment. This cognitive based therapy combines acceptance and change strategies to help individuals recognize their behaviors and mood swings, and process negative thoughts and feelings.
