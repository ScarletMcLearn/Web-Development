If you feel down for longer than two weeks or so, you may be clinically depressed. With clinical depression, people often feel hopeless, lack interest in day-to-day activities or loved ones, and experience changes in eating and sleeping habits. There may even be thoughts of death or suicide.\nFrequent bouts of anxiety or panic. Feeling afraid, even when there\u2019s reason, is a normal reaction after experiencing extremely stressful events. But, when you still feel this way several weeks after the event, you may have something called an anxiety disorder.\nFlashbacks and frequent nightmares. Traumatic events, such as combat, often trigger nightmares and vivid, sudden memories called flashbacks. If they persist for several weeks or months, you may have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It can make you feel indifferent, avoid people and responsibilities, become \u201cjumpy,\u201d or have panic attacks.\nFrequent alcohol and drug abuse. When people are in pain, they sometimes try to \u201cself-medicate\u201d with alcohol and drugs. This almost always results in even worse trouble.\nDomestic violence/abuse. When troubled by your feelings or experiences, you may feel like lashing out at your family members.\nPrevious mental health problems or past trauma. You may experience the symptoms of your disorder or see new ones emerge.\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "If you are experiencing any of these, you should seek help.
