Give Freedom"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "This tip can be scary for you as the caregiver and potentially for the individual you are helping.

Giving a person the freedom to choose what treatment they receive, what they eat, where they live, who they associate with, their work status, and to make decisions regarding their education is considered self-determination. When individuals take control of their lives, even in small ways, it improves their outlook on life and mental health."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Self-determination is best fostered in the family and among caregivers. Together with your family member or friend, evaluate what decisions your loved one currently makes and discuss things that are being done for them which can be done on their own. For some people, choosing where they live and whom they live with may help them feel confident, empowered and strengthen recovery. For others, those decisions may be overwhelming and increase anxiety. If this is the case, brainstorm other areas where they can practice self-determination such as, preparing one's own meals, taking initiative in household chores, or picking a hobby or leisure time activity to pursue. \u00a0This resource is a great guide for your loved one to fill out at their own pace in order to take greater control of their life.\n\t\u00a0"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "4.

Your loved one is going through hard times and they may say or do things that are out of character or that they don't intend to be hurtful. Continue to love them and be their friend; set boundaries to ensure you do not get hurt physically or emotionally. Remember that your friend does not need another mental health professional. They need someone that they can laugh with, enjoy their time with, feel accepted by regardless of their illness, and that they can trust and depend on. Follow your family member or friend\u2019s cue; if they want to talk, be ready to listen. \u00a0If they do not want to talk, support them and show that you are there for them when they are ready.\n\t\u00a0"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "5.
