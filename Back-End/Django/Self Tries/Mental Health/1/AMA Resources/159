Scientific evidence suggests that in many cases the disorder is genetically transmitted and is caused by an imbalance or deficiency in certain chemicals that regulate the efficiency with which the brain controls behavior. A 1990 study at the National Institute of Mental Health correlated ADD with a series of metabolic abnormalities in the brain, providing further evidence that ADD is a neurobiological disorder.\u00a0\n\tWhile heredity is often indicated, problems in prenatal development, birth complications, or later neurological damage can contribute to ADD. There is little scientific evidence to suggest that environmental factors, dietary factors such as food dyes or sugar, inner-ear problems or \u201cvisual motor\u201d difficulties are the underlying cause of ADD."}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "The Prevalence Of ADD In Adults"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "The prevalence of ADD in adults is unknown; very few have been studied. In the few treatment studies of adults, there does not appear to be a significant sex difference. About two-thirds of the children who are diagnosed in or before elementary school with ADD continue to have behavioral symptoms in adolescence. During this time period, associated behavioral, learning, and emotional problems also manifest themselves. Approximately one-third to one-half of these adolescents continue to have symptoms of ADD during their adult years."}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "The Diagnosis Of ADD In Adults"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "A multifactored evaluation of an individual is important in the diagnosis of ADD. Diagnostic assessment of adults should be made by a clinician or a team of clinicians with expertise in the area of attentional dysfunction and related conditions."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "The assessment is designed to look for the presence of lifelong patterns of behavior that indicate underlying attention and impulse problems. An evaluation should make use of information from a variety of sources. These may include:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nA thorough medical and family history.\nA physical examination.\nInterviews or rating scales completed by others who can comment on the person\u2019s behavior, such as a parent, friend or spouse.\nObservation of the individual.\nPsychological tests which measure cognitive abilities, social and emotional adjustment, as well as screen for learning disabilities.\nVarious symptoms of ADD may reflect developmental differences in some individuals while in others, they may indicate that other conditions co-exist with ADD, including specific learning disabilities, anxiety disorders, affective disorders, Tourette\u2019s syndrome, borderline personality disorders, and obsessive compulsive disorder.\n"}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "ADD With Hyperactivity"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "ADD with hyperactivity is characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity which have an onset before age seven, which persist for at least six months, and which are not due primarily to other psychiatric disorders or environmental circumstance, such as reaction to family stresses."}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "ADD Without Hyperactivity"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "The primary characteristic of ADD without hyperactivity is significant inattentiveness. Studies of children with this diagnosis indicate that they show more signs of anxiety and learning problems, and qualitatively different inattention. Although there have been no adult follow-up studies, it is projected that children who have ADD without hyperactivity may have different outcomes than the hyperactive group, who show more externalizing behavior problems associated with oppositional and conduct disorders."}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "Characteristics Of Adults With ADD"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Adults who are living with the condition, and especially those who are undiagnosed and untreated, may be experiencing a number of problems, some of which stem directly from the disorder and others that are the result of associated adjustment patterns."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Current symptoms of an adult with ADD may include:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nDistractibility\nDisorganization\nForgetfulness\nProcrastination\nChronic lateness\nChronic boredom\nAnxiety\nDepression\nLow self-esteem\nMood swing\nEmployment problems\nRestlessness\nSubstance abuse or addictions\nRelationship problems\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "The symptoms of ADD can be variable and situational, or constant. Some people with ADD can concentrate if they are interested or excited, while others have difficulty concentrating under any circumstances. Some avidly seek stimulation, while others avoid it. Some become oppositional, ill-behaved and, later, antisocial; others may become ardent people-pleasers. Some are outgoing, and other, withdrawn."}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "Why Identify ADD In Adults?"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Identification of adults who have ADD and appropriate management of their educational, personal, and social development improves their chances for a successful outcome. Effective intervention can improve self-esteem, work performance and skills, and educational achievement."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "A proper diagnosis of ADD can help an adult put his or her difficulties into perspective. These individuals have often developed low self-esteem and negative perceptions of themselves as a result of cumulative academic, social, and vocational failures.

Appropriate treatment is determined according to the severity of an individual\u2019s disorder and the type and number of associated problems.\n\tMany people have benefited from a treatment plan that includes medication. Used in conjunction with education and counseling, it can provide a base from which adults can build new successes. The purpose of medication is to help the adult to help him or herself. It provides the biological support needed for self-control. As such, the individual is not \u201ccontrolled\u201d by medication; the efforts to succeed are his or her own."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Some tips that adults with ADD have found useful include:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nUse internal structure.\u00a0This includes using date books, lists, notes to oneself, color coding, routines, reminders and files.\nChoose \u201cGood Addictions.\u201d\u00a0Select exercise or other healthy, favorite activities for a regular structured \u201cblow-out\u201d time.\nSet up a Rewarding Environment.\u00a0Design projects, tasks, etc., to minimize or eliminate frustration. Break large tasks into smaller ones; prioritize.\nUse Time-outs.\u00a0Take time to calm down and regain perspective when upset, overwhelmed or angry. Walk away from a situation if needed.\nUse Humor.\u00a0It\u2019s useful if partners and colleagues are constantly providing an aggressive push to help one stay on track as long as it\u2019s done with humor and sensitivity. Learn to view symptoms of ADD with humor and to joke with close friends and relatives about symptoms such as getting lost, forgetfulness, etc.\nBecome Educated and an Educator.\u00a0Read books. Talk to professionals. Talk to other adults who have ADD. Let people who matter know about personal strengths and weaknesses related to ADD. Be an advocate.\n"}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "Other Resources"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorders (CHADD)\n\t8181 Professional Place\n\tSuite 150\n\tLandover, MD 20785\n\tPhone Number: (301) 306-7070\n\tToll-Free Number: (800) 233-4050\n\tFax-Number: (301) 360-7090\n\tWebsite URL:\u00a0www.chadd.org\n\tInformation Obtained From The C.H.A.D.D Fact Sheet: Attention Deficit Disorders Not Just For Children"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Get additional information about ADD at Psych Central."}]}
