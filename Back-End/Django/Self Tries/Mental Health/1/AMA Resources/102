It plays a role in sending messages about appetite, sleep, and mood.6 It is the target of medications known as SSRIs or SNRIs, which are used to treat anxiety and depression.\n\n\n\nDopamine is involved in controlling movement and the body\u2019s reward response system. Due to its role in how the body perceives rewards, it is heavily involved with addictions. When amounts of this chemical messenger are low, it is linked to mental health conditions including depression, schizophrenia, and psychosis.7\n\n\n\nGlutamate and GABA (gamma-amino butyric acid) both act to regulate the activity of nerve cells in the parts of the brain that process visual information, determine heart rate, and affect emotions and the ability to think clearly.8 Low levels of GABA have been linked to depression, anxiety, PTSD, and mood disorders.9\n\n\n"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "\u00a0"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Exercise Can Help Prevent Mental Illnesses And Is An Important Part Of Treatment"}, {"tag": "table", "content": "\n\n\nJust 1 hour of exercise a week is related to lower levels of mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders.10\n\nAmong people in the U.S., those who make regular physical activity a part of their routines are less likely to have depression, panic disorder, and phobias (extreme fears).11\n\n\nOne study found that for people with anxiety, exercise had similar effects to cognitive behavioral therapy in reducing symptoms.12\n\nFor people with schizophrenia, yoga is the most effective form of exercise for reducing positive and negative symptoms associated with the disorder.13\n\n\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "\u00a0"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "How Much Exercise Should You Be Getting?"}, {"tag": "table", "content": "\n\n\n\nExercise doesn\u2019t have to be done for hours on end.
