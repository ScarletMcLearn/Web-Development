Whether by talking on the phone, video chatting or written letters, you and your partner probably succeeded in staying close but, now that you\u2019re back to living together, some fine-tuning may be needed for the relationship to run smoothly again."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Here are some tips on how to reconnect:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nExpect everything to feel a little awkward at first.\u00a0It\u2019s entirely normal. You haven't spent time in one another's presence in a while, so you have to get back in the routine of being together. The awkwardness\u00a0has the potential to be part of the fun of reuniting - remember your first kiss as a couple? That was probably a little awkward, but in an exciting kind of way.\nDon\u2019t rush things.\u00a0Take some time to get to know each other again. To avoid disappointment, make intimacy \u2013 not sex \u2013the focus of your reunion. Sex can resume immediately, but intimacy takes longer to re-establish. Set aside time to do something fun together\u00a0where you can put the responsibilities of life on the back burner for an hour or two and enjoy each other's company.\nBe sensitive to your spouse\u2019s needs.\u00a0Acknowledge the differences between men and women. Men tend to focus on the physical relationship while women may concentrate more on verbal communication and affection.\nCommunicate.\u00a0Talk with your spouse about your wartime experiences and what you\u2019re feeling. It will help relieve your stress as well as your spouse\u2019s.\nAvoid power struggles.\u00a0It\u2019s very important to acknowledge the many responsibilities your spouse had to shoulder in your absence. Take time to ease back into your routine, or create a new routine. Be clear about who is in responsible for\u00a0what. This covers everything, from parenting duties\u00a0to paying the bills on time.\nCheck yourself emotionally to see if you\u2019ve brought home any \u201cextra baggage\u201d\u00a0(such as mood swings, or new bad habits) from the battlefield. Encourage your partner to do the same in a way that is constructive. When talking about these issues, ask your partner to\u00a0focus on behaviors and feelings (For example, \"When you're short with me, I feel like I've done something to upset you,\" is a lot better than, \"You have a bad temper lately.\").\u00a0Try not to react negatively if he or she shares some observations about your behavior. Instead, think about why you might be acting or feeling a certain way, and\u00a0do whatever\u2019s necessary to resolve the issues before they take a toll on your relationship.\nMake the most of the homecoming opportunity.\u00a0This is your chance to address things about your relationship that you or your spouse didn\u2019t like before, like a fresh start,\u00a0or to build upon the intimacy you\u2019ve always shared.\nIf the relationship becomes strained, get a \u201csecond opinion.\u201d\u00a0All couples can benefit from the objective observations of another party. You have many options to choose from: your faith leader, a service chaplain, a family services counselor or a mental health professional. Keep your relationship strong by getting the help you need.\u00a0\n"}]}
