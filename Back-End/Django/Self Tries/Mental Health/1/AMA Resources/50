Because women are most likely to experience depression during the primary reproductive years (25 to 45), they are especially vulnerable to developing depression during pregnancy and after childbirth. Women who develop these disorders do not need to feel ashamed or alone; treatment and support are available.\nWhat are the postpartum blues or \u201cbaby blues?\u201d\nPostpartum blues are very common, occurring in up to 80 percent of new mothers. Characterized by mood swings, postpartum blues or \u201cbaby blues\u201d are normal reactions that many mothers experience following childbirth. The onset of postpartum blues usually occurs three to five days after delivery, and should subside as hormone levels begin to stabilize. Symptoms generally do not last for more than a few weeks. If a person continues to experience moods swings or feelings of depression for more than two weeks after childbirth, the problem may be more serious.\nWhat is postpartum depression (PPD)?\nPostpartum depression (PPD) is a major form of depression and is less common than postpartum blues. PPD includes all the symptoms of depression but occurs only following childbirth. It can begin any time after delivery and can last up to a year. PPD is estimated to occur in approximately 10 to 20 percent of new mothers.\nWhat are the symptoms of PPD?\nSymptoms of PPD are the same as those for clinical depression and may include specific fears such as excessive preoccupation with the child\u2019s health or intrusive thoughts of harming the baby. Given the stressful circumstances of caring for a new baby, it is understandable that new mothers may be more tired, irritable and anxious. But when a new mother is experiencing drastic changes in motivation, appetite or mood she should seek the help of a mental health professional. For a clinical diagnosis of postpartum depression to be made, symptoms of PPD generally must be present for more than two weeks following childbirth to distinguish them from postpartum blues.\nWhat are the factors that contribute to PPD?\nThe causes of PPD are not quite clear but research suggests that the following factors may contribute to the onset of PPD:\n\n\nHormonal changes:\u00a0A woman experiences the greatest hormonal fluctuation levels after giving birth. Intense hormone fluctuations, such as decreased serotonin levels, occur after delivery and may play a role in the development of PPD.\n\n\nSituational risks:\u00a0Childbirth itself is a major life change and transition, and big changes can cause a great deal of stress and result in depression. If a major event coincides with childbirth, a mother may be more susceptible than average to PPD.\n\n\nLife Stresses:\u00a0Ongoing stressful circumstances can compound the pressures of having a new baby and may trigger PPD. For example, excessive stress at the office added to the responsibilities of being a mother can cause emotional strain that could lead to PPD. The nature of the mother\u2019s relationship with the baby\u2019s father and any unresolved feelings about the pregnancy might also affect a mother\u2019s risk of getting PPD.\n\n\nWhat treatments are available?\nTaking antidepressant medication may help alleviate the symptoms of PPD and should be combined with ongoing counseling with a therapist trained in issues surrounding childbirth. Studies show that some antidepressant medications have no harmful effects on breastfeeding infants. Psychotherapy alone may also be used to treat PPD. New mothers should be encouraged to talk about their feelings or fears with others. Socializing through support groups and with friends can play a critical role in recovery. Exercise and good nutrition may improve a new mother\u2019s mood and also aid in recovery. Caffeine should be avoided because it can trigger anxiety and mood changes.\nCan PPD lead to other problems?\nWhen a new mother has severe depression, the vital mother-child relationship may become strained. She may be less able to respond to her child\u2019s needs. Several studies have shown that the more depressed a new mother is, the greater the delay in the infant\u2019s development. A new mother\u2019s attention to her newborn is particularly important immediately following birth because the first year of life is a critical time in cognitive development.\nIs PPD preventable?\nIn most cases PPD is preventable; early identification can lead to early treatment. A major part of prevention is being informed about the risk factors and the medical community can play a key role in identifying and treating PPD. Women should be screened by their physician to determine their risk for acquiring PPD. Because social support is also a vital factor in prevention, early identification of mothers who are at risk can enable a woman to seek support from physicians, partners, friends, and coworkers.\nWhat is birth-related post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?\nAfter childbirth, women may also experience post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD includes two key elements: (1) experiencing or witnessing an event involving actual or threatened danger to the self or others, and (2) responding with intense fear, helplessness or horror.\nSymptoms of birth-related PTSD may include:\n\n\nObsessive thoughts about the birth\n\n\nFeelings of panic when near the site where the birth occurred\n\n\nFeelings of numbness and detachment\n\n\nDisturbing memories of the birth experience\n\n\nNightmares\n\n\nFlashbacks\n\n\nSadness, fearfulness, anxiety or irritability\n\n\nWhat is postpartum psychosis?\nIn rare cases, women may experience postpartum psychosis (PPP), a condition that affects about one-tenth of 1 percent of new mothers. Onset is quick and severe, and usually occurs within the first two to three weeks following childbirth. Symptoms are similar to those of general psychotic reactions such as delusions (false beliefs) and hallucinations (false perceptions), and often include:\n\n\nPhysical symptoms: Refusal to eat, inability to cease activity, frantic energy.\n\n\nMental symptoms: Extreme confusion, memory loss, incoherence.\n\n\nBehavioral symptoms: Paranoia, irrational statements, preoccupation with trivial things.\n\n\nA woman who is diagnosed with PPP should be hospitalized until she is in stable condition. Doctors may prescribe a mood stabilizer, antipsychotic or antidepressant medications to treat postpartum psychosis. Mothers who experience PPP are highly likely to suffer from it again following their next pregnancy.\nOther Resources\nDepression after Delivery\nhttp://www.charityadvantage.com/depressionafterdelivery/Home.asp\n\t\tA national clearinghouse that offers information, treatment referrals, educational materials, telephone support, and support groups for new mothers as well as links to information for new dads.\nPostpartum Support International\nwww.postpartum.net\n\t\tProvides information for new moms and dads, on-line list of support groups, chats and discussion boards, share a story section, bookstore, etc.\nOther Web resources:\nAmerican Academy of Family Physicians\nwww.aafp.org\nOBGYN.net\nwww.obgyn.net\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Psych Central\n\n<!--/*--><![CDATA[/* ><!--*/\n<!--td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;}-->\n\t\n/*--><!]]>*/\n\nhttps://psychcentral.com/disorders/postpartum-depression/"}]}
