A stroke occurs when blood cannot get to the brain.

High blood pressure, the primary risk factor for mutli-infarct dementia, can be treated successfully. Diabetes also is a treatable risk for stroke. To prevent additional strokes, doctors may prescribe medicines to control high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart disease, and diabetes. They will counsel patients about good health habits such as exercising, avoiding smoking and drinking alcohol. The patient may require a special diet."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Doctors sometimes prescribe aspirin or other drugs to prevent clots from forming in the small blood vessels. Drugs also can be prescribed to relieve restlessness or depression or to help the patient sleep better. Sometimes doctors recommend a surgery known as carotid endartectomy. This surgery is done to remove blockage in the carotid artery, the main blood vessel to the brain. Studies are under way to see how well this surgery works in treating patients with mult-infarct dementia.
