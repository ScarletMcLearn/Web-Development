Symptoms like irritability, changes in sleep or appetite, and loss of interest in certain activities that the child/teen used to enjoy, could be associated with puberty or be early signs of a mental health problem.\u00a0\u00a0 For more information see our infographic \u2013 Puberty or Problems."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "How long have the symptoms been going on?\u00a0"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Has your child been struggling over the last few days? Weeks? Months? Now that you\u2019ve determined what symptoms your child is experiencing, it\u2019s important to establish when symptoms started, whether they are persistent or come and go, and if they have gotten worse over time. Mental health problems tend to last for longer than 1-3 days.

For instance, if your child/teen is worried every morning before school and sad afterward, but seemingly better on weekends, this could be a sign of bullying or other difficulties with their peer group and be best addressed by finding a way to improve their school environment. In cases of girls and young women, mood swings may align with hormonal cycles and require little or no action, or an evaluation from a gynecologist. Maybe changes in mood are due to a triggering event, like a fight with a friend or trauma.\u00a0 In these moments, it\u2019s important to identify the triggering event and provide a safe space for your child to express and work through thoughts and feelings. On the other hand, some events or situations may act signs or symptoms of a mental health problem. For instance, if your child/teen has a minor physical problem (i.e. ache or bump), obsesses over the problem and seems convinced they are dying because of it, or struggles to breath when worrying, they could be showing signs of an anxiety problem.\u00a0 Taking notice of details can help determine the nature of problems and what kind of actions you should take to best address them."}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Where to Start Getting Help"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\n\nSchool support staff. If you feel like your child needs accommodations in school, it\u2019s worthwhile to start early in soliciting support from the school system.\u00a0 The process of obtaining an Individualized Education Program (IEP) can be daunting and complicated, but hang in there.\u00a0 You will first have to request an evaluation.\u00a0 It is best to do this in writing.\u00a0 Having prior treatment or testing through a psychologist might help you to talk about why your child is eligible and conceptualize the kinds of changes that can help in school.\u00a0 Until then, other school support staff (guidance counselor, school social worker, or a teacher) might also provide extra support and guidance.

Mental health conditions are real, and common, and most of the time symptoms start during youth.\u00a0 It is important to take your child seriously if they\u2019ve come to you in need of help, because the sooner you are able to address their problems, the more likely they will be to get better.\u00a0\n\n\nGuilt \u2013 It can be easy to think about all the \u201cwhat ifs\u201d, and things you should have or could have done when your child tells you they are struggling with their mental health.\u00a0 While it can be easy to think this way, it certainly isn\u2019t helpful.\u00a0 Keep your focus on what your child has told you and how you can help him or her moving forward, rather than dwelling on the past.
