It will take determination, persistence and time. Some suggestions may help immediately, but if your stress is chronic, it may require more attention and/or lifestyle changes. Determine YOUR tolerance level for stress and try to live within these limits. Learn to accept or change stressful and tense situations whenever possible."}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nBe realistic. If you feel overwhelmed by some activities (yours and/or your family\u2019s), learn to say NO! Eliminate an activity that is not absolutely necessary. You may be taking on more responsibility than you can or should handle. If you meet resistance, give reasons why you\u2019re making the changes. Be willing to listen to other\u2019s suggestions and be ready to compromise.\nShed the \u201csuperman/superwoman\u201d urge. No one is perfect, so don\u2019t expect perfection from yourself or others. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat really needs to be done?\u201d How much can I do? Is the deadline realistic? What adjustments can I make?\u201d Don\u2019t hesitate to ask for help if you need it.\nMeditate.\u00a0 Just ten to twenty minutes of quiet reflection may bring relief from chronic stress as well as increase your tolerance to it. Use the time to listen to music, relax and try to think of pleasant things or nothing.\nVisualize. Use your imagination and picture how you can manage a stressful situation more successfully. Whether it\u2019s a business presentation or moving to a new place, many people feel visual rehearsals boost self-confidence and enable them to take a more positive approach to a difficult task.\nTake one thing at a time.\u00a0 For people under tension or stress, an ordinary workload can sometimes seem unbearable. The best way to cope with this feeling of being overwhelmed is to take one task at a time. Pick one urgent task and work on it. Once you accomplish that task, choose the next one. The positive feeling of \u201cchecking off\u201d tasks is very satisfying. It will motivate you to keep going.\nExercise. Regular exercise is a popular way to relieve stress. Twenty to thirty minutes of physical activity benefits both the body and the mind.\nHobbies. Take a break from your worries by doing something you enjoy. Whether it\u2019s gardening or painting, schedule time to indulge your interest.\nHealthy life style. Good nutrition makes a difference. Limit intake of caffeine and alcohol (alcohol actually disturbs regular sleep patterns), get adequate rest, exercise, and balance work and play.\nShare your feelings.\u00a0 A conversation with a friend lets you know that you are not the only one having a bad day, caring for a sick child or working in a busy office. Stay in touch with friends and family. Let them provide love, support and guidance. Don\u2019t try to cope alone.\nGive in occasionally. Be flexible! If you find you\u2019re meeting constant opposition in either your personal or professional life, rethink your position or strategy. Arguing only intensifies stressful feelings. If you know you are right, stand your ground, but do so calmly and rationally. Make allowances for other\u2019s opinions and be prepared to compromise. If you are willing to give in, others may meet you halfway. Not only will you reduce your stress, you may find better solutions to your problems.\nGo easy with criticism. You may expect too much of yourself and others. Try not to feel frustrated, let down, disappointed or even \u201ctrapped\u201d when another person does not measure up. The \u201cother person\u201d may be a wife, a husband, or child whom you are trying to change to suit yourself. Remember, everyone is unique, and has his or her own virtues, shortcomings, and right to develop as an individual.\n"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "\u200bWhere to Get Help"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Help may be as close as a friend or spouse.
