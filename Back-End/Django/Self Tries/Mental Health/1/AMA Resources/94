It can be tempting to act on what you\u2019re feeling right away, but that often doesn\u2019t fix the situation that caused the emotions. In fact, it may lead to more problems to deal with down the road.\u00a0"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Some of the harmful ways that people deal with negative emotions:"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Denial"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Denial is when a person refuses to accept that anything is wrong or that help may be needed. When people deny that they are having problematic feelings, those feelings can bottle-up to a point that a person ends up \u201cexploding\u201d or acting out in a harmful way."}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Withdrawal"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Withdrawal is when a person doesn\u2019t want to be around, or participate in activities with other people. This is different than wanting to be alone from time to time, and can be a warning sign of depression. Some people may withdraw because being around others takes too much energy, or they feel overwhelmed. Others may withdraw because they don\u2019t think other people like them or want them to be around. In some cases, people who have behaviors that they are ashamed of may withdraw so other people don\u2019t find out about what they are doing. But withdrawal brings its own problems: extreme loneliness, misunderstanding, anger, and distorted thinking. We need to interact with other people to keep us balanced."}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Bullying"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Bullying is when a person uses force, threats, or ridicule to show power over others. People typically take part in bullying behavior because they don\u2019t feel good about themselves and making someone else feel bad makes them feel better about themselves or feel less alone. It is harmful to both the bully and the person being bullied and does not address underlying issues.\u00a0"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Self-harm\u00a0"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Self-harm can take many forms including: cutting, starving one\u2019s self, binging and purging, or participating in dangerous behavior. Many people self-harm because they feel like it gives them control over emotional pain. While self-harming may bring temporary relief, these behaviors can become addictive and can lead people to be more out of control and in greater pain than ever."}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Substance use\u00a0"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Substance use is the use of alcohol and other drugs to make a person feel better or numb about painful situations. Alcohol and drug use can damage the brain, making it need higher amounts of substances to get the same effect. This can make difficult feelings even worse and in some cases, leads to suicidal thoughts or addiction.
