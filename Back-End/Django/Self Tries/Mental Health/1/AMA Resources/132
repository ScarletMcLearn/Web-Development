It occurs when a child is targeted by one or more youth with repeated negative actions over a period of time. These are intentional attempts to cause discomfort or injury and can include name-calling, obscene gesturing, malicious teasing, exclusion, threats, rumors, physical hitting, kicking, pushing and choking. Cyber-bullying is also a real and growing problem today.\u00a0 Make no mistake: bullying of any kind is a form of violence that should not be tolerated."}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "See the Scope of the Problem"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nThe Journal of the American Medical Association reports that one-third of U.S. students experience bullying, either as a target or a perpetrator.\nMore than 70 percent of teachers and students have witnessed bullying in their schools.\u00a0[1]\n28 percent of students, in 6th through 12th grade, report being bullied.\u00a0[2]\nOnly a small percentage of children who are bullied, report it.\u00a0 The reason is often because they do not believe adults will help them.\u00a0 [3]\n"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Spot the Bullies"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nBoth boys and girls bully.

Teach kids to respect others before they start school and continue to talk about this topic on an ongoing basis. Even small acts of teasing should be stopped in their tracks. Don\u2019t fail to correct this kind of behavior due to a child\u2019s young age. This is exactly when to stop it.\nTeach your children how to be assertive.\u00a0Encourage your children to express their feelings clearly, say no when they feel uncomfortable or pressured, stand up for themselves without fighting and walk away in dangerous situations.\nStop bullying when you see it. Adults who remain silent when bullying occurs are encouraging it and making it worse.\nListen and support children who speak up. Telling an adult about bullying is not easy for children.\u00a0 If a child comes to you seeking assistance with bullying, spend time listening to them and provide affirmation and support before taking actions. \u00a0Read through and discuss our Bullying Checklist with your child as a resource.\nRecognize the signs of depression.\u00a0 Youth who experience persistent bullying can develop signs of depression like sadness, isolation, poor concentration and sleeping problems. These symptoms can affect their relationships and school performance.\u00a0 Many children do not recognize or speak up about their emotional needs. Make sure to reach out and get them help when you see these signs.\nTell your children to take action when they see bullying behavior.\u00a0Tell them to speak out against the bully and inform a teacher if the behavior doesn\u2019t stop. Bullying continues only when we allow it to.\nCommunicate clear policies and consequences.\u00a0Bullying is less likely in schools where adults are involved and firm about stopping bullying behaviors. Send out a clear message at your school that bullying will have negative consequences.\nTeam up. Work with your PTA or local MHA affiliate to make sure that schools treat bullying as violence. Help them develop programs to prevent bullying and promote safe school environments.\n"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Other Resources"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "You can find more helpful information about bullying at\u00a0http://www.stopbullying.gov/."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Check out this online Guide to Bullying and Cyberbullying."}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "References"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "[1]\u00a0Bradshaw, C.P., Sawyer, A.L., & O\u2019Brennan, L.M.
