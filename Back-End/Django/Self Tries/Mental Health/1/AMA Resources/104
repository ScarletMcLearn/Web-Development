If you feel comfortable talking to the counselor or doctor, the next step is to make an appointment.\nOn your first visit, the therapist or doctor will want to get to know you and why you called him or her. The therapist will want to know\u2014what you think the problem is; about your life; what you do; where you live and with whom you live. It is also common to be asked about your family and friends. This information helps the professional to assess your situation and develop a plan for treatment.\nAs you progress through the therapeutic process, you should begin to feel gradual relief from your distress, to develop self-assurance and have a greater ability to make decisions and increased comfort in your relationship with others. Therapy may be painful and uncomfortable at times but episodes of discomfort occur during the most successful therapy sessions. Mental health treatment should help you cope with your feelings more effectively.\nThe following are a few common types of therapy:\n\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has two main aspects. The cognitive part works to develop helpful beliefs about your life. The behavioral side helps you learn to take healthier actions.\n\n\nInterpersonal therapy focuses largely on improving relationships and helping a person express emotions in healthy ways.\n\n\nFamily therapy helps family members communicate, handle conflicts and solve problems better.\n\n\nPsychodynamic therapy helps people develop a better understanding about their unconscious emotions and motivations that can affect their thoughts and actions.\n\n\nArt therapy can include using music, dance, drawing and other art forms to help express emotions and promote healing.\n\n\nPsychoeducation helps people understand mental health conditions and ways to promote recovery.\n\n\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Sources"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "1 Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Results from the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health: Mental Health Findings, NSDUH Series H-47, HHS Publication No. (SMA) 13-4805.
