For children, the death of a loved one can affect their sense of security. Like adults, children express loss by grieving. Yet children may not demonstrate the grief in the same manner as adults. Pre-schoolers usually see death as temporary; between the ages of 5 and 9, children begin to experience grief more like adults.

To lessen confusion, avoid expressions such as quot;passed on\" or \"went to sleep.\" Answer their questions about death simply and honestly. Only offer details that they can absorb. Don't overload them with information.\nChildren can be fearful about death and the future. Don't offer false comfort. Give them a chance to talk about their fears and validate their feelings. Offer a simple expression of sorrow and take time to listen.\nChildren are repetitive in their grief. Respond patiently to their uncertainty and concerns. It can take a long time to recover from a loss.\nChildren are physical in their grief. Watch their bodies, understand and support their play and actions as their \"language\" of grief. Offer reassurance.\nChildren grieve cyclically. Expect their grief to revisit in cycles throughout their childhood or adolescence. A strong reminder, such as the anniversary of a death, may reawaken grief. Make yourself available to talk.\nChildren need choices. Whenever possible, offer choices in what they do or don't do to memorialize the deceased and ways to express their feelings about the death.\nChildren grieve as part of a family. Expect children to mourn the deceased and the environment that existed before the death. Children may grieve the \"changed\" behavior of family and friends. Keep regular routines as much as possible.\n"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Resources"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Help is available.
