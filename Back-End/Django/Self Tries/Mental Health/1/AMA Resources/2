You must learn to accept or change stressful or tense situations whenever possible.

When that's done, move on to the next.\n\n\nBe realistic.\u00a0lf you're overwhelmed at home or at work, learn to say, \"No!\"\n\n\nDon't try to be superman/superwoman.\u00a0No one is perfect, so don't expect perfection from yourself.\n\n\nVisualize.\u00a0Use your imagination to see how you can manage a stressful situation at work or home more effectively.\n\n\nMeditate.\u00a0Five to 10 minutes of quiet reflection can bring some relief. If you're having a stressful day at work, close your door and meditate or go for a quick walk to clear your mind.\n\n\nExercise.\u00a0Thirty minutes of physical activity per day helps both body and mind. If you have an hour lunch break at the office, use half of it for a walk or a jog. Make plans with a coworker to do this a few times a week.\n\n\nHobbies.\u00a0Take a break and do something you enjoy.\n\n\nAdopt a healthy lifestyle.\u00a0Get adequate rest, eat right, exercise, limit your use of caffeine and alcohol, and balance work and play.\n\n\nShare your feelings.\u00a0Don't try to cope alone. Let friends and family provide support and guidance.\n\n\nBe flexible!\u00a0Whether you're at home or at work, arguing only increases stress. If you feel you're right, stand your ground, but do so calmly and rationally. Be prepared to make allowances for other people's opinions and to compromise.\n\n\nDon't be overly critical.\u00a0Remember, everyone is unique and has his or her own virtues and shortcomings.\n\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "You can ease stress by talking with friends or family.
