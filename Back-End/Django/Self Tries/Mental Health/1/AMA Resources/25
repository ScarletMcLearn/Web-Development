{"title": "Social Support: Getting and Staying Connected", "source": "http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/stay-connected", "contents": [{"tag": "ul", "content": "\nMake a short list of friends and family members who are supportive and positive. Also include a list of people you feel the need to stay in touch with regularly such as parents, a close friend or adult child who lives far away, or an aging relative who lives alone.\nMake a commitment to yourself to call, email or get together with them on a schedule that\u2019s reasonable for you. Try to reach out to make at least one emotional connection a day, but plan realistically. In cases of long distance, consider using web-based ways of keeping in touch, like Skype or Facebook.\nShare what\u2019s on your mind honestly and openly. Talk about your concerns in a straight-forward way, but try to keep it constructive. Try to be direct about what you need \u2013 for example a sympathetic ear, help solving a problem, a fresh perspective, new ideas or a good laugh. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask for the kind of help you\u2019d like. Ask what other people think about your situation, and show them you value their opinion.\nWhen you talk, also listen. Ask about someone else\u2019s day, or follow up on the topic of a previous conversation. Showing sincere interest in another person\u2019s life builds relationships and listening to other people\u2019s concerns can often shed a new light on your own challenges. Offer help or advice if asked \u2013 listen and respond.\nMake social plans. Create opportunities to strengthen your relationships with fun things that both you and your friend or relative will enjoy. Looking forward to special activities boosts our spirits, gives us energy and makes us more productive.\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "You may find that among people you hardly know, one or more can become trusted friends you can rely on\u2014and support\u2014in good times and bad. Even if you feel that you\u2019re so busy you don\u2019t have time to keep up with family and friends you already have, it doesn\u2019t take much time to make new friends. If you\u2019re shy and hesitant about meeting new people, just a few questions can get a conversation going. Think about neighbors you pass regularly, co-workers, people in your exercise class, a cousin you\u2019ve lost touch with, or those who volunteer in the same organizations you do. If you don\u2019t already have people you can talk with regularly about what\u2019s on your mind, it\u2019s worth the effort to build connections for your emotional health. If you find yourself anxious or timid about social interaction, you may want to consider talking to a therapist or counselor to build your confidence in social situations."}, {"tag": "table", "content": "\n\n\n\nDid You Know?\n\n\n\n\nA study that followed participants over the course of 20 years found that a person\u2019s level of happiness was related to the happiness of their social networks. If a person had a happy friend who lived within a mile, the person themselves was 25% more likely to be happy as well. In addition, it found that a person\u2019s happiness can be related to the happiness of someone separated by up to three degrees (a friend of a friend of a friend).2\nLow level of social interaction was found to have an impact on lifespan equivalent to smoking nearly a pack of cigarettes a day or being an alcoholic, and was twice as harmful as being obese.3\nYour body\u2019s chemicals play a role in your social connections. The hormone, oxytocin, influences social behavior by increasing relationship bonds and trust.4\n\n\n\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "\u00a0"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Social Media"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "An increasingly popular way of connecting with others is through social media.
