It helps a lot for someone to know they aren\u2019t alone. Make sure you don\u2019t switch the topic of conversation to your struggles though; focus on their needs.\n\n\nAvoid being judgmental.\u00a0Don\u2019t tell them they are being weird or crazy; it\u2019s not helpful at all.\n\n\nTake them seriously.\u00a0Try not to respond with statements that minimize how they are feeling or what they are going through, such as, \u201cYou\u2019re just having a bad week,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing.\u201d\n\n\nMake yourself available to talk again if needed.\u00a0While it can be a big relief for someone to share something they have been keeping secret, mental health struggles usually aren\u2019t solved with one conversation.\u00a0 Let the person who has spoken with you know that they can reach out to you again if they are having a tough time.\u00a0It\u2019s ok to let them know if there is a time of day or certain days of the week that you aren\u2019t available.\u00a0 For instance, \u201cI\u2019m here for you if you need to talk, but my parents don\u2019t let me use the phone after 9 on school nights, so call before then.\n\n\nDon't turn what you've been told into gossip.\u00a0If someone is talking to you about their mental health, it was probably tough for them to work up the nerve to say something in the first place and you shouldn\u2019t share what they tell you with other students at school. Let them share on their own terms.\n\n\nIf you don't understand, do some research and learn about what you've been told.\u00a0Make sure that your information is coming from reliable sources like government agencies and health organizations.\n\n\nTell an adult if you have to.\u00a0It\u2019s important to have friends that trust you, but if a friend indicates they have thoughts or plans of hurting themself or another person, have been hearing voices or seeing things that no one else can hear or see, or have any other signs and symptoms that shouldn\u2019t be ignored then you need to tell an adult what is going on. That doesn\u2019t make you a bad friend; it just means that the problem requires more help than you can give.\u00a0If someone you know is in crisis and needs help urgently, call 1-800-273-TALK (8255), text 741741, go to your local Emergency Room or call 911.\n\n"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Now what?"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "If you\u2019ve made the decision to talk to someone about your mental health, you may be nervous about how things will go and what could happen.
