Neuroleptic drugs are generally prescribed for psychiatric disorders, as well as for some gastrointestinal and neurological disorders. Neuroleptic drugs work by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps control the brain\u2019s reward and pleasure centers but also plays a major role in motor functioning. As a result, neuroleptic drugs can cause disorders affecting the motor system."}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nInfographic: Tardive Dyskinesia: A Serious Side Effect\nInfographic: 5 Steps For Taking On Tardive Dyskinesia\u00a0\nPatrick's Story: I have Tardive Dyskinesia, but I am one of the lucky ones\n"}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "How common is tardive dyskinesia?"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Tardive dyskinesia is estimated to affect at least 500,000 people in the U.S.[1]"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Those who have been treated for schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and/or bipolar disorder are particularly at risk."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "The older a person is, the\u00a0more likely they are to develop\u00a0persistent and irreversible tardive dyskinesia. \u00a0"}, {"tag": "p", "content": ""}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Tardive dyskinesia is characterized by repetitive and involuntary movements."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Features of the disorder may include:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nFrowning\nTongue sticking out\nLip smacking\nPuckering and pursing of the lips\u00a0\nRapid eye blinking\u00a0\nRapid movements of the arms, legs, and trunk may also occur.\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Approximately 60 to 70 percent of the cases are mild, with about 3 percent being extremely severe."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Severe cases may involve problems such as difficulty swallowing, speech interference, disfigured facial features, and breathing trouble."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Download this questionnaire\u00a0to see if you, or someone you love may be experiencing signs of tardive dyskinesia."}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "Tardive dyskinesia and Parkinson's disease: What's the difference?"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Tardive dyskinesia is not to be mistaken with Parkinson\u2019s disease.

Most interventions focus on adjusting the medication thought to be causing tardive dyskinesia. In many cases neuroleptic medications will be adjusted to use the lowest possible dose, or discontinued if at all possible. Stopping the medication is a gradual process, lowering the doses 10 to 25 percent every one to three months. Replacing the neuroleptic drug with other medications may help some patients. Other drugs such as tranquilizers like benzodiazepines and medicines that mimic the effect of dopamine, may also be beneficial. Symptoms of tardive dyskinesia may remain even after the medication is stopped. However, with careful management, some symptoms may improve or disappear with time."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Tardive dyskinesia symptoms may take time to develop. On some occasions symptoms do not arise until after neuroleptic drug use has been stopped. For this reason, tardive dyskinesia may be hard to diagnose. If you think you have tardive dyskinesia seek medical attention through a neurologist. For a diagnosis, doctors should evaluate the length of neuroleptic drug exposure. Exposure does not need to be consistent but should continue for three or more months of use. They should also rule out other conditions that cause movements such as Parkinson\u2019s or Cerebral Palsy and recognize symptoms in two or more body areas.
