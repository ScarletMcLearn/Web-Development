Seasonal depression typically occurs when the seasons change and most symptoms begin in the fall and continue into the winter months. However, seasonal depression can occur in the summer or spring, although this is less common. [1,2,3,5]"}, {"tag": "div", "content": "\n\u00a0Prevalence\n\nIn a given year, about 5 percent of the U.S. population experiences seasonal depression. [2]\nFour out of five people who have seasonal depression\u00a0are women. [2]\nThe main age of onset of seasonal depression is between 20\u00a0and 30 years of age, however symptoms can appear earlier. [2]\nThe prevalence of seasonal depression\u00a0is anywhere from 0-10 percent of the population, depending on the geographic region. [2,3]\nTypically, the further one is from the\u00a0equator, the more at risk they are for seasonal depression. [1]\n\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of seasonal depression are typically consistent with those that occur with depression, and sometimes it can difficult to tell if someone has seasonal depression or other types of depression.[1] Symptoms that are typically more common in seasonal depression than in other forms of depression are carbohydrate craving, increased appetite, excessive sleepiness, and weight gain.[2] A diagnosis of seasonal depression can be made after two\u00a0consecutive occurrences\u00a0of depression that occur and end at the same time every year, with the symptoms subsiding the rest of the year. [5] Specific symptoms of seasonal depression can include:\n\n\nDepression:\u00a0misery, guilt, loss of self-esteem, hopelessness, diminished interest in activities,\u00a0despair, and apathy\n\n\nAnxiety:\u00a0tension and inability to tolerate stress\n\n\nMood\u00a0changes:\u00a0extremes of mood and, in some, periods of mania in spring and summer\n\n\nSleep problems:\u00a0desire to oversleep and difficulty staying awake or, sometimes, disturbed sleep and early morning waking\n\n\nLethargy:\u00a0feeling of fatigue and inability to carry out normal routine\n\n\nOvereating:\u00a0craving for starchy and sweet foods resulting in weight gain\n\n\nSocial\u00a0problems:\u00a0irritability and desire to avoid social contact\n\n\nSexual\u00a0problems:\u00a0loss of libido and decreased interest in physical contact\n\n\nCauses\n\nThe reduced level of sunlight in the fall and winter months may affect an\u00a0individual\u2019s serotonin, a neurotransmitter that affects mood. Lower levels of serotonin have been shown to be linked to\u00a0depression.\u00a0Brain scans\u00a0have shown that people who had seasonal depression in the winter had higher levels of a serotonin transporter protein that removed serotonin than in\u00a0individuals who did not have seasonal depression. [2,4]\nMelatonin, a sleep-related hormone secreted by the pineal gland in the brain, has been linked to seasonal depression.\u00a0This hormone, which can affect sleep patterns and mood,\u00a0is produced at increased levels in the dark.\u00a0Therefore, when the days are shorter and darker the production of this hormone increases. Melatonin can also affect an individual's circadian rhythm, or \"biological\u00a0clock\",\u00a0resulting in\u00a0\u2018internal clocks\u2019 being out of sync with \u2018external clocks\u2019, or the usual sleep/wake rhythms. This can result in some of the symptoms associated with seasonal depression. [1,2,3,4]\n\nTreatments for Seasonal Affective Disorder\n\n\nPhototherapy or bright light therapy has been shown to suppress the brain\u2019s secretion of melatonin. Although, there have been no research findings to definitely link this therapy with an antidepressant effect, light therapy has been shown to be effective in up to 85 percent of diagnosed cases. Patients remain in light up to ten times the intensity of normal domestic lighting up to four hours a day, but may carry on normal activities such as eating or reading while undergoing treatment.\u00a0 The device most often used today is a bank of white fluorescent lights on a metal reflector and shield with a plastic screen. [1,2,3]\n\n\nIf phototherapy does not work, an antidepressant drug may prove effective in reducing or eliminating symptoms, but there may be unwanted side effects to consider.\u00a0 Discuss your symptoms thoroughly with your family doctor and/or mental health professional. [1,2,3]\n\n\nIn some studies,\u00a0Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) has also been shown to be effective; however, research is limited. [3]\n\n\nPrevention\nSince seasonal depression has a predictable pattern of recurrence, preventative measures may help to reduce symptoms. Some forms of prevention that can help include beginning light therapy in the early fall before the onset of symptoms, exercising more, increasing the amount of light at home, meditation and other stress management techniques, spending more time outside, and visiting climates that have more sun.
