This helps to keep your body\u2019s natural rhythms running on schedule.\nAvoid exercising 2-3 hours before your bedtime. Try to exercise in 30 minute sessions either in the morning or afternoon.\nGet out in the sun. Getting natural sunlight during the day helps to maintain your body\u2019s sleep-wake cycle. Aim for 30 minutes of sun exposure and be sure to wear sunscreen.\nLimit caffeine to the morning. The energy-boosting effects of caffeine can take as long as 8 hours to wear off.\nDon\u2019t eat right before bed \u2013 it can cause indigestion and heartburn, which can mess up sleep.\nNap smart. If you need a nap, take it before 3 p.m. and limit it to an hour.\nIf you can\u2019t fall asleep for more than 20 minutes after going to bed, get up and do something calming until you feel sleepy.\nSay no to nicotine. The nicotine in tobacco products and vapes is a stimulant, which can keep you up at night.\nSee a doctor if you always feel tired even after getting enough sleep, or have trouble falling asleep every night.\nSome over-the-counter and prescription medications may affect your ability to go to sleep or cause you to sleep for longer than necessary. If you can\u2019t avoid medications, talk to your doctor about changing your dose or the time you take your medicine\nGet rid of anything in your bedroom that might distract you from sleep, like noises or bright lights. The light from screens can confuse your body\u2019s internal clock.\nGo easy on the drinks. Drinking too much before be can make you wake up to go to the bathroom and alcohol gets in the way of reaching the deep and restful stages of sleep.\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Join Mental Health America this May as we challenge ourselves to make small changes \u2013 both physically and mentally \u2013 to create hug gains for our overall health and wellbeing."}, {"tag": "p", "content": ""}, {"tag": "p", "content": "If you are taking steps to live a healthy lifestyle but still feel like you are struggling with your mental health, visit www.mhascreening.org to check your symptoms.
