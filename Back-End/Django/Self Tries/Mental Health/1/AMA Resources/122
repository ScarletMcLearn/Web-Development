These youth often misinterpret the actions of others as being hostile or aggressive and respond by escalating the situation into conflict. Conduct disorder may also be associated with other difficulties such as substance use, risk-taking behavior, school problems, and physical injury from accidents or fights."}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "How common is Conduct Disorder?"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Conduct disorder is more common among boys than girls, with studies indicating that the rate among boys in the general population ranges from 6% to 16% while the rate among girls ranges from 2% to 9%. Conduct disorder can have its onset early, before age 10, or in adolescence. Children who display early-onset conduct disorder are at greater risk for persistent difficulties, however, and they are also more likely to have troubled peer relationships and academic problems. Among both boys and girls, conduct disorder is one of the disorders most frequently diagnosed in mental health settings."}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "What does the research say about Conduct Disorder?"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "\n\tRecent research on Conduct Disorder has been very promising. For example, research has shown that most children and adolescents with conduct disorder do not grow up to have behavioral problems or problems with the law as adults; most of these youth do well as adults, both socially and occupationally. Researchers are also gaining a better understanding of the causes of conduct disorder, as well as aggressive behavior more generally. Conduct disorder has both genetic and environmental components. That is, although the disorder is more common among the children of adults who themselves exhibited conduct problems when they were young, there are many other factors which researchers believe contribute to the development of the disorder. For example, youth with conduct disorder appear to have deficits in processing social information or social cues, and some may have been rejected by peers as young children."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "\u00a0"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Despite early reports that treatment for this disorder is ineffective, several recent reviews of the literature have identified promising approaches treating children and adolescents with conduct disorder. The most successful approaches intervene as early as possible, are structured and intensive, and address the multiple contexts in which children exhibit problem behavior, including the family, school, and community. Examples of effective treatment approaches include functional family therapy, multi-systemic therapy, and cognitive behavioral approaches which focus on building skills such as anger management. Pharmacological intervention alone is not sufficient for the treatment of conduct disorder."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "\u00a0"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Conduct disorder tends to co-occur with a number of other emotional and behavioral disorders of childhood, particularly\u00a0Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)and\u00a0Mood Disorders (such as depression).

The assessment process should include observation of the child, discussion with the child and family, the use of standardized instruments or structured diagnostic interviews, and history-taking ,including a complete medical and family / social history.
