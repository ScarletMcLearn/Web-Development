They may complain of very real stomach cramps or headaches, and be reluctant to go to school. It\u2019s important to remember that these children are not \"being bad\" --they\u2019re afraid. Here are some suggestions to help them cope with their fears:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\n\nReassure young children that they\u2019re safe. Provide extra comfort and contact by discussing the child\u2019s fears at night, by telephoning during the day and with extra physical comforting.\n\n\nGet a better understanding of a child\u2019s feelings about the tragedy. Discuss the tragedy with them and find out each child\u2019s particular fears and concerns. Answer all questions they may ask and provide them loving comfort and care. You can work to structure children\u2019s play so that it remains constructive, serving as an outlet for them to express fear or anger.\n\n"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "GRADE-SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Children this age may ask many questions about the tragedy, and it\u2019s important that you try to answer them in clear and simple language. If a child is concerned about a parent who is distressed, don\u2019t tell a child not to worry--doing so will just make him or her worry more."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Here are several important things to remember with school-age children:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\n\nFalse reassurance does not help this age group. Don\u2019t say tragedys will never affect your family again; children will know this isn\u2019t true. Instead, say \u201cYou\u2019re safe now and I\u2019ll always try to protect you,-- or--Adults are working very hard to make things safe.\u201d Remind children that tragedys are very rare. Children\u2019s fears often get worse around bedtime, so you might want to stick around until the child falls asleep in order to make him or her feel protected.\n\n\nMonitor children\u2019s media viewing. Images of the tragedy and the damage are extremely frightening to children, so consider limiting the amount of media coverage they see. A good way to do this without calling attention to your own concern is to regularly schedule an activity--story reading, drawing, movies, or letter writing, for example--during news shows.\n\n\nAllow them to express themselves through play or drawing. As with younger children, school-age children sometimes find comfort in expressing themselves through playing games or drawing scenes of the tragedy. Allowing them to do so, and then talking about it, gives you the chance to \"re-tell\" the ending of the game or the story they have expressed in pictures with an emphasis on personal safety.\n\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to say \"I don\u2019t know.\" Part of keeping discussion of the tragedy open and honest is not being afraid to say you don\u2019t know how to answer a child\u2019s question. When such an occasion arises, explain to your child that tragedys are extremely rare, and they cause feelings that even adults have trouble dealing with. Temper this by explaining that, even so, adults will always work very hard to keep children safe and secure.\n\n"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "ADOLESCENTS"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Encourage these youth to work out their concerns about the tragedy. Adolescents may try to down-play their worries. It is generally a good idea to talk about these issues, keeping the lines of communication open and remaining honest about the financial, physical and emotional impact of the tragedy on your family. When adolescents are frightened, they may express their fear through acting out or regressing to younger habits."}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\n\nChildren with existing emotional problems such as depression may require careful supervision and additional support.\n\n\nMonitor their media exposure to the event and information they receive on the Internet.\n\n\nAdolescents may turn to their friends for support.
