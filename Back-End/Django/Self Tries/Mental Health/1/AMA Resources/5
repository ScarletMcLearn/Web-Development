Good mental health allows children to think clearly, develop socially and learn new skills.\u00a0 Additionally, good friends and\u00a0 encouraging words from adults are all important for helping children develop self confidence, high self-esteem, and a healthy emotional outlook on life."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "A child\u2019s physical and mental health are both important."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Basics for a child\u2019s good physical health:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\n\nNutritious food\n\n\nAdequate shelter and sleep\n\n\nExercise\n\n\nImmunizations\n\n\nHealthy living environment\n\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Basics for a child\u2019s good mental health:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\n\nUnconditional love from family\n\n\nSelf-confidence and high self-esteem\n\n\nThe opportunity to play with other children\n\n\nEncouraging teachers and supportive caretakers\n\n\nSafe and secure surroundings\n\n\nAppropriate guidance and discipline\n\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Give children unconditional love."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Love, security and acceptance should be at the heart of family life.\u00a0 Children need to know that your love does not depend on his or her accomplishments."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Mistakes and/or defeats should be expected and accepted.

Allow children to explore and play in a safe area where they cannot get hurt.\u00a0 Assure them by smiling and talking to them often. Be an active participant in their activities. Your attention helps build their self-confidence and self-esteem.\n\n\nSet Realistic Goals - Young children need realistic goals that match their ambitions with their abilities. With your help, older children can choose activities that test their abilities and increase their self-confidence.\n\n\nBe Honest - Do not hide your failures from your children. It is important for them to know that we all make mistakes. It can be very re-assuring to know that adults are not perfect.\n\n\nAvoid Sarcastic Remarks - If a child loses a game or fails a test, find out how he or she feels about the situation. Children may get discouraged and need a pep talk. Later, when they are ready, talk and offer assurance.\n\n\nEncourage children - To not only strive to do their best, but also to enjoy the process. Trying new activities teaches children about teamwork, self-esteem and new skills.\n\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Make time for play!"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Encourage Children to Play"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "To children, play is just fun.
