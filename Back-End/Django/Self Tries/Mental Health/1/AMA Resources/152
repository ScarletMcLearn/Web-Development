We don\u2019t ignore them. In fact, we develop a plan of action to reverse and sometimes stop the progression of the disease.

Often there is a sense that something is \u201cnot right.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nStage 2\nSymptoms Increase in Frequency and Severity and Interfere with Life Activities and Roles\n\n\nAt Stage 2, it usually becomes obvious that something is wrong.\u00a0 A person\u2019s symptoms may become stronger and last longer or new symptoms may start appearing on top of existing ones, creating something of a snowball effect. Performance at work or school will become more difficult, and a person may have trouble keeping up with family duties, social obligations or personal responsibilities.\n\n\n\n\nStage 3\nSymptoms Worsen with Relapsing and Recurring Episodes Accompanied by Serious Disruption in Life Activities and Roles\n\n\nAt Stage 3, symptoms have continued to increase in severity, and many symptoms are often taking place at the same time. A person may feel as though they are losing control of their life and the ability to fill their roles at home, work or school.\n\n\n\n\nStage 4\nSymptoms are Persistent and Severe and Have Jeopardized One's Life\n\n\nBy Stage 4, the combination of extreme, prolonged and persistent symptoms and impairment often results in development of other health conditions and has the potential to turn into a crisis event like unemployment, hospitalization, homelessness or even incarceration. In the worst cases, untreated mental illnesses can lead to loss of life an average of 25 years early.\n\n\n\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "\u00a0"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Early Identification and Intervention"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Catching mental health conditions early is known as Early Identification and Intervention. However, many times people may not realize that their symptoms are being caused by a mental health condition or feel ashamed to pursue help because of the stigma associated with mental illness.\u00a0 It\u2019s up to all of us to know the signs and take action so that mental illnesses can be caught early and treated, and we can live up to our full potential.
