If you do not understand, ask how your child is feeling and how you can best support them. Validate their feelings instead of immediately offering solutions.\n\n\nLearn: Learn more about eating disorders and recovery, including facts and myths. Reading about or speaking with other parents who have supported their children in recovery is also helpful and is often a part of treatment programs.\n\n\nSupport: Remind them that you are there to support them and just want them to be well. Focus on positive personality traits and emotional health instead of exclusively focusing on food-related behavior. Model recovery in your own relationship with food, weight, and exercise, and work to create an environment where the whole family is promoting healthy behaviors and alternatives.\n\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "If your child denies having a problem, simply and calmly:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nRepeat what you have observed, i.e., evidence that there is a problem\nRepeat your concern about their health and well-being\nRepeat your conviction that the circumstance at least be evaluated by a counselor or therapist\nEnd the conversation if it is going nowhere or it either of your become too upset.\nTake any actions necessary for you to further your responsibilities.\nLeave the door open for further conversation\n"}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "Do Not: [4]"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nJudge: When your child is struggling or discusses something personal, do not express judgment, make jokes, or be dismissive of their thoughts, feelings, or behaviors.
