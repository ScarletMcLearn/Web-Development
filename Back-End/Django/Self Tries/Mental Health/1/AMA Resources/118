However, if you don\u2019t deal with the stress, it can be harmful to your mental and physical health. Here are some tips for coping in these difficult times:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nTalk about it.\u00a0By talking with others about the event, you can relieve stress and realize that others share your feelings.\nSpend time with friends and family.\u00a0They can help you through this tough time. If your family lives outside the area, stay in touch by phone. If you have any children, encourage them to share their concerns and feelings about the disaster with you.\nTake care of yourself.\u00a0Get plenty of rest and exercise, and eat properly. If you smoke or drink coffee, try to limit your intake, since nicotine and caffeine can also add to your stress.\nLimit exposure to images of the disaster.\u00a0Watching or reading news about the event over and over again will only increase your stress.\nFind time for activities you enjoy.\u00a0Read a book, go for a walk, catch a movie or do something else you find enjoyable. These healthy activities can help you get your mind off the disaster and keep the stress in check.\nTake one thing at a time.\u00a0For people under stress, an ordinary workload can sometimes seem unbearable. Pick one urgent task and work on it. Once you accomplish that task, choose the next one. \u201cChecking off\u201d tasks will give you a sense of accomplishment and make things feel less overwhelming.\nDo something positive.\u00a0Give blood, prepare \u201ccare packages\u201d for people who have lost relatives or their homes or jobs, or volunteer in a rebuilding effort. Helping other people can give you a sense of purpose in a situation that feels \u2018out of your control.\u2019\nAvoid drugs and excessive drinking.\u00a0Drugs and alcohol may temporarily seem to remove stress, but in the long run they generally create additional problems that compound the stress you were already feeling.\nAsk for help when you need it.\u00a0If your feelings do not go away or are so intense that they interfere with your ability to function in daily life, talk with a trusted relative, friend, doctor or spiritual advisor about getting help. Make an appointment with a mental health professional to discuss how well you are coping with the recent events. You could also join a support group. Don\u2019t try to cope alone. Asking for help is not a sign of weakness.\n"}]}
