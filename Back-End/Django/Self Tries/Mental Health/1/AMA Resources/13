Some children may be hesitant to initiate such conversation, so you may want to prompt them by asking if they feel safe at school, in their neighborhood, or in public places. When talking with younger children remember to talk on their level. For example, they may not understand the term \u201cviolence\u201d but can talk to you about being afraid of\u00a0a classmate who is mean to them or about something they heard on TV (or saw online).\u00a0 Encourage them to express their feelings through talking, drawing or playing.\n\n\nValidate the child\u2019s feelings. Do not minimize a child\u2019s concerns.\u00a0Let him/her know that serious acts of violence are not as common or likely\u00a0as they may seem, despite\u00a0so much media attention.\n\n\nTalk honestly about your own feelings\u00a0regarding violence. It is important for children to recognize they are not dealing with their fears alone.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be afraid to say \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u00a0 Part of keeping a\u00a0discussion open is not being afraid to say you don\u2019t know how to answer a child\u2019s question.\u00a0 When such an occasion arises, explain to your child that acts of violence can't always be explained and\u00a0cause feelings that even adults have trouble dealing with.\u00a0 Temper this by explaining that, even so, adults will always work very hard to keep children safe and secure.\n\n\nDiscuss the safety procedures\u00a0that are in place at your child\u2019s school, in your neighborhood, and in other public places. Arrange a presentation by McGruff the Crime Dog, a member of the local police force, or a neighborhood watch captain.\n\n\nCreate safety plans with your child. Help identify which adults (a friendly secretary, trusted neighbor or security guard) your child can talk to if they should feel threatened. Also ensure that your child knows how to reach you (or another family member or friend) in case of crisis.\u00a0 Remind your child that they can talk to you anytime they feel threatened.\n\n\nRecognize behavior that may indicate your child is concerned about their safety.\u00a0 Younger children may react to violence by not wanting to attend school or go out in public.\u00a0 Behavior such as bed-wetting, thumb sucking, baby talk, or a fear of sleeping alone may intensify in some younger children, or reappear in children who had previously outgrown them. Teens and adolescents may minimize their concerns outwardly, but may become argumentative, withdrawn, or allow their school performance to decline.\n\n\nEmpower children\u00a0to take action regarding their safety. Encourage them to report specific incidents (such as bullying, threats or talk of suicide, or weapons) and to develop problem solving and conflict resolution skills. Encourage older children to actively participate in student-run anti-violence programs.\n\n\nKeep the dialogue going\u00a0and make safety a common topic in family discussions rather than just a response to an immediate crisis.\u00a0 Open dialogue will encourage children to share their concerns.\n\n\nSeek help when necessary.\u00a0 If you are worried about a child\u2019s reaction or have ongoing concerns about his/her behavior or emotions, contact your pediatrician or a mental health professional at school or at your community mental health center.\u00a0 Find your local MHA Affiliate here.\u00a0\n\n"}, {"tag": "div", "content": "\u00a0"}, {"tag": "h3", "content": "Additional Resources"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nSAMHSA\u2019s Coping With Grief After Community Violence\u00a0\u00a0offers information on common distress reactions following community violence + resources for coping, including for parents and caregivers of children & youth.\u00a0\nThe Child Development Institute has additional information about How to Talk to Kids about Tragedies in the Media.\n"}]}
