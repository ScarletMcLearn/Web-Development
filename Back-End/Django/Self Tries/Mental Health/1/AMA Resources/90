Reassure them that their feelings are normal.\nChildren's reactions to deployment and current events\u00a0may be heavily influenced by your own. Your reactions are key in helping children decide whether the world is a safe or scary place.\nChildren need comforting and frequent reassurance that they\u2019re safe \u2013 make sure you give it to them.\nProvide activities for children that help them explore their feelings, such as classroom discussions, informal play, community service projects, and writing, music, art or drama projects.\nMaintain family routines and keep the lines of communication open.\nCreate a family plan to follow in the event of an emergency.\n"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Here are some more tips on how to help children of all ages deal with the subject of war:"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Grade-school age children"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nExpect questions\u00a0from this age group. Try to answer them in simple and clear language. Use a map or globe to illustrate how far away their deployed family member or the conflict\u00a0is. Also, explain that the police and many others are working hard to keep us safe here at home.\nIf a child is concerned about a family member, such as a parent, serving overseas, don\u2019t tell them not to worry. Explain that a lot of people are also concerned about Mom or Dad being safe and that Mom or Dad have practiced their job a lot for this moment in time.\nBe honest. False reassurance doesn\u2019t help this age group. Don\u2019t say, \"Nobody will get hurt.\" Children know this isn\u2019t true. Instead say, \u201cI will always be here to keep you safe\u201d or \u201cAdults are working very hard to make things safe.\u201d\nMonitor their television viewing. Limit the amount of war coverage they see. Schedule an alternate activity during the news hour without calling attention to your real concern. A walk around the block, homework, a good movie or a fun dinner won\u2019t necessarily make kids feel like they\u2019re being restricted.\nDon\u2019t be afraid to say, \"I don\u2019t know.\" Part of keeping an open dialogue with your children is not being afraid to say that you don\u2019t have all the answers. When you don\u2019t, explain that military conflicts or terrorism are very complicated and things happen that even adults don\u2019t understand.\n"}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "Middle- and high school age youth"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\nPlan for shared time in front of a reliable national newscast. Because the issue will likely be discussed in school, your teen may be more ready to talk when he or she gets home than you\u2019d guess. This is a good opportunity for conversation.\nDiscussing relevant history with this age group can help put things\u00a0in context.\nGet teens to open up about what they\u2019ve heard. Use the opportunity to correct any misinformation they may have acquired.\nThis age group may ask very technical or even grisly questions that may seem off the wall to you. Take each question seriously and do the best you can to answer it.\nEncourage them to work out their own positions on the issues \u2013 even they differ\u00a0from your own. This is an age when young people\u00a0are developing personal ethics and morals, a process you can support with open discussion and debate.\nCreate a family plan to follow in the event of an emergency. Make sure that each family member has everyone\u2019s phone/cell numbers and knows where to meet. This will make teens feel safer and may help reduce panic if an emergency does occur.\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "\u00a0"}]}
