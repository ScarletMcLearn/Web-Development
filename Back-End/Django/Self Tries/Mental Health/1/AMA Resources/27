Going to a party or even having a one-on-one conversation with a new person can result in increased heart rate, sweating, and racing thoughts for someone with social anxiety. When social anxiety gets significant, it\u2019s common for individuals to isolate and feel very alone, making recovery harder."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Ultimately, it can make it difficult for a person to live the life they want: the excessive fear of humiliation and rejection can limit them in work, school, and relationships. While most people have concerns about acceptance and embarrassment, the extreme anxiety and dread that accompany social anxiety disorder are so overwhelming that a person may find it hard to function in daily life and may avoid the anxiety-inducing situations altogether."}, {"tag": "h2", "content": "How common is Social Anxiety Disorder?"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Fifteen million, or seven percent, of American adults have Social Anxiety Disorder [1].

In Social Anxiety Disorder, this can include things like calling a friend, talking to a stranger, applying for a job or public speaking. Exposure therapy is highly successful, as overtime an individual learns that he or she is able to handle the fear-inducing situations."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Medications: In conjunction with talk therapies, medications like antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and beta-blockers are sometimes used in the treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder."}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Support: Because social phobia can lead to isolation, finding support groups with others who have similar experiences can be an important part of recovery.
