As a person starts small with choosing what to eat, what to wear, what hobbies to pursue, and what friends to have they will be better prepared to make big decisions such as where to live, who to live with, where to work, whether or not to obtain a higher education, what treatment to receive, etc. This builds their strength to live with their mental illness and have a higher quality of life. \u00a0"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Support Self-determination\n\tAs your loved one becomes more self-determined support them in their decisions. Feel free to provide guidance, but allow the decision to be their own. Naturally, if the decision jeopardizes the health and safety of your loved one or others, you should intervene. Depending on the person you care for, it may be helpful to list options for them to choose from. For example, if your child who has a mental illness is choosing where to live but you and their medical team agrees they should not live by themselves, discuss your concerns and give suggestions. As long as their decision does not endanger them or others, support them. Giving an individual the ability to choose and supporting their choices can empower them, boost their confidence, and help them feel proactive in their recovery. \u00a0"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Employment\n\tBy law, employers are not allowed to discriminate due to health status. As a caregiver, encourage your loved one to work if they are capable. Having a job, part-time or full-time, is a great way for an individual to learn self-determination and to help them return to recovery. Some individuals are not able to work due to current health conditions or the possibility of losing disability benefits; if your loved one is in this position, consider talking with them about volunteer work or other alternatives which foster self-determination.
