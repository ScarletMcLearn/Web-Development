Omega 3s can also be found in albacore tuna, walnuts, flax seeds, chia seeds, and dark green leafy vegetables like brussels sprouts, kale and spinach.\n\u00a0\nPeople who eat diets rich with Omega 3 fatty acids have up to 30% reduced risk of depression.16\n\u00a0\nFish oil supplements that are high in the EPA type of Omega 3 fatty acids can help mental health. Studies show they can benefit some people with depression as much as anti-depressants.17\n\nB-group vitamins help to regulate neurotransmitters, immune function, and amino acids \u2013 the building blocks of proteins in the body.\n\u00a0\nFolate and folic acid are part of the B family of vitamins and can be found in green leafy vegetables, legumes, and whole grains.\n\u00a0\nPeople who eat foods rich in folate have a lower risk of depression.18\n\u00a0\nFish (salmon, trout, tuna), beef, lamb, clams, poultry (chicken and turkey), eggs, and milk are natural sources of vitamin B12. Breakfast cereals with vitamin B12 added are a good option for vegetarians.\n\u00a0\nPeople with a lack of vitamin B12 may be at increased risk for depression, especially if they are older.19\n\nVitamin D is important for optimal brain functioning, including mood and critical thinking.\n\u00a0\nFatty fish like salmon and tuna have the most naturally occurring vitamin D.\u00a0 Some vitamin D can also be found in eggs, other dairy foods, and fortified beverages and breakfast cereals. Cod liver oil supplements are high in vitamins A and D and have some omega 3 fatty acids as well.\n\u00a0\nSunlight is a major source of vitamin D. Five to thirty minutes of sun exposure twice a week generally produces enough vitamin D in the body.\u00a0 Lighter-skinned people require less time in the sun than those with darker skin.\n\u00a0\nLow levels of vitamin D are linked to depression,20 particularly seasonal depression which happens with reduced sunlight during winter.\n\n\n\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "\u00a0"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "Join Mental Health America this May as we challenge ourselves to make small changes \u2013 both physically and mentally \u2013 to create huge gains for our overall health and wellbeing."}, {"tag": "p", "content": ""}, {"tag": "p", "content": "If you are taking steps to live a healthy lifestyle but still feel like you are struggling with your mental health, visit www.mhascreening.org to check your symptoms.
