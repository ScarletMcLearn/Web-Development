When talking with younger children remember to talk on their level. For example, they may not understand the term \u201cviolence\u201d but can talk to you about being afraid or a classmate who is mean to them.\n\n\nTalk honestly about your own feelings regarding school violence.\u00a0It is important for children to recognize they are not dealing with their fears alone.\n\n\nValidate the child\u2019s feelings.\u00a0Do not minimize a child\u2019s concerns. Let him/her know that serious school violence is not common, which is why incidents such as Columbine and Conyers, Georgia, attract so much media attention. Stress that schools are safe places. In fact, recent studies have shown that schools are more secure now than ever before.\n\n\nEmpower children to take action regarding school safety.\u00a0Encourage them to report specific incidents (such as bullying, threats or talk of suicide) and to develop problem solving and conflict resolution skills. Encourage older children to actively participate in student-run anti-violence programs.\n\n\nDiscuss the safety procedures that are in place at your child\u2019s school.\u00a0Explain why visitors sign in at the principal\u2019s office or certain doors remain locked during the school day. Help your child understand that such precautions are in place to ensure his or her safety and stress the importance of adhering to school rules and policies.\n\n\nCreate safety plans with your child.\u00a0Help identify which adults (a friendly secretary, trusted teacher or approachable administrator) your child can talk to if they feel threatened at school. Also ensure that your child knows how to reach you (or another family member or friend) in case of crisis during the school day. Remind your child that they can talk to you anytime they feel threatened.\n\n\nRecognize behavior that may indicate your child is concerned about returning to school.\u00a0Younger children may react to school violence by not wanting to attend school or participate in school-based activities. Teens and adolescents may minimize their concerns outwardly, but may become argumentative, withdrawn, or allow their school performance to decline.\n\n\nKeep the dialogue going\u00a0and make school safety a common topic in family discussions rather than just a response to an immediate crisis. Open dialogue will encourage children to share their concerns.\n\n\nSeek help when necessary.\u00a0If you are worried about a child\u2019s reaction or have ongoing concerns about his/her behavior or emotions, contact a mental health professional at school or at your community mental health center. Your local Mental Health Association or the National Mental Health Association\u2019s Information Center can direct you to resources in your community.\n\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "\u00a0The following behaviors are signs that a child may need help:"}, {"tag": "ul", "content": "\n\nLack of interest or poor performance in school\n\n\nAbsence of age-appropriate anger control skills\n\n\nSeeing self as always the victim\n\n\nPersistent disregard for or refusal to follow rules\n\n\nCruelty to pets or other animals\n\n\nArtwork or writing that is bleak or violent or that depicts isolation or anger\n\n\nTalking constantly about weapons or violence\n\n\nObsession with violent games and/or TV shows\n\n\nLack of enthusiasm, energy or motivation\n\n\nCarrying a weapon to school\n\n\nOverreacting to criticism\n\n\nRestlessness and agitation\n\n\nBullying\n\n\nMisplaced or unwarranted jealousy\n\n\nInvolvement with or interest in gangs\n\n\nWithdrawal from friends and activities\n\n"}, {"tag": "p", "content": "\u00a0The more signs you see the greater the chance the child needs help.
