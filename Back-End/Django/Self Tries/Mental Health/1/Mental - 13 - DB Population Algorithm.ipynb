      "p : Stress is a natural part of life. You can feel physical stress when you have too much to do, or when you've had too little sleep, aren't eating properly or have been ill. Stress can also be emotional: you can feel it when you worry about money, your job or a loved one's illness, or when you experience a devastating life event, such as the death of a spouse or the loss of a job. When stress is not addressed, it can affect many parts of your life, including your productivity and performance on the job. In fact, workplace stress causes about 1 million U.S. employees to miss work each day.\n",
      "p : The key to coping with stress is to determine your personal tolerance levels for stressful situations. You must learn to accept or change stressful or tense situations whenever possible. Some of the following suggestions may help immediately, but if your stress is constant, it may require more attention or even lifestyle changes.\n",

It simply means you’re no longer operating in high gear and that things are beginning to settle down. Or, it can mean that your homecoming was not everything you’d hoped it would be. Occasionally, the letdown can become a more serious problem that requires professional assistance.\n",
      "p : Here are some signs that mean it’s time to get help:\n",
      "ul : \n",
      "Long bouts of depression. If you feel down for longer than two weeks or so, you may be clinically depressed. With clinical depression, people often feel hopeless, lack interest in day-to-day activities or loved ones, and experience changes in eating and sleeping habits. There may even be thoughts of death or suicide.\n",
      "Frequent bouts of anxiety or panic. Feeling afraid, even when there’s reason, is a normal reaction after experiencing extremely stressful events. But, when you still feel this way several weeks after the event, you may have something called an anxiety disorder.\n",
      "Flashbacks and frequent nightmares. Traumatic events, such as combat, often trigger nightmares and vivid, sudden memories called flashbacks. If they persist for several weeks or months, you may have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It can make you feel indifferent, avoid people and responsibilities, become “jumpy,” or have panic attacks.\n",
      "Frequent alcohol and drug abuse. When people are in pain, they sometimes try to “self-medicate” with alcohol and drugs. This almost always results in even worse trouble.\n",
      "Domestic violence/abuse. When troubled by your feelings or experiences, you may feel like lashing out at your family members.\n",

      "p : If you are experiencing any of these, you should seek help. With professional help and support you can overcome these problems. Everyone needs help from time to time in dealing with the stresses of life. It’s also best to act on these problems as early as possible. You have many options to choose from: support groups, anger management classes, your faith leader, a service chaplain, a family services counselor or mental health professional.

      "http://www.mentalhealthamerica.net/conditions/what-peer\n",
      "div : \n",
      "\n",
      "Put simply, a peer is a person we identify with in some capacity. This can include anything from age to gender to sexual orientation to shared language. \n",
      "\n",
      "In behavioral health, a peer is usually used to refer to someone who shares the experience of living with a psychiatric disorder and/or addiction. In that narrow context two people living with those conditions are peers, but in reality most people are far more specific about whom they would rely on for peer support. Trust and compatibility are extremely important factors.\n",
      "Peer support is the “process of giving and receiving encouragement and assistance to achieve long-term recovery.” Peer supporters “offer emotional support, share knowledge, teach skills, provide practical assistance, and connect people with resources, opportunities, communities of support, and other people” (Mead, 2003; Solomon, 2004). In behavioral health, peers offer their unique lived experience with mental health conditions to provide support focused on advocacy, education, mentoring, and motivation. \n",
      "Peer providers can play many roles in support for people living with psychiatric disorders and/or in addiction recovery. They are capable of facilitating education and support groups and working as a bridge linking people to services as they transition from hospitals or jails into the community. Peers also work one-on-one as role models, mentors, coaches and advocates and support people in developing psychiatric advance directions and creating Wellness Recovery Action Plans (WRAP).\n",
      "Peers go by many names and can work in many different settings. Many peers have additional training and certification that demonstrates their skills and knowledge. Combined with their lived experience and ability to engage and connect with consumers, peer supporters are a dynamic and growing group that continue to transform lives and systems. \n",
      "History\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The concept of “peer support” in mental health has its roots in the self-help movement that began in the 1970s. During a time of intense focus on civil rights and social change, people who had survived the abuses of psychiatric hospitals came together to support each other and work towards healing. \n",
      "They understood there was more to recovery than “symptom management” and that individuals who had been hospitalized were capable of supporting one another and living meaningful lives in the community.\n",
      "Present\n",
      "Thanks to the leadership of peers and the growing evidence around the practice over the past decades, the peer workforce has grown to over 24,000 supporters working in all 50 states and U.S. territories. Considered an evidence-based practice by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), peer support is Medicaid reimbursable in over 41 states.\n",
      "From the criminal justice system to housing services to hotlines, peers model recovery and contribute to the lives of others.\n",
      "Future \n",
      "MHA peers have been moving into the private sector and have the potential to be integrated into all areas of health. The private health sector offers a wide array of work opportunities for qualified peer support workers including working in private practice alongside mental health professionals, primary care, Emergency Departments, and supervision roles. As more people learn about peers and the importance of recovery-oriented systems, peers will play a central role in supporting people living with mental health conditions and helping to empower them to live meaningful lives in the community.\n",
